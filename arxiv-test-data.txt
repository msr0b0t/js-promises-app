{"abstract":"We provide a general set of rules for extracting the data defining a quiver gauge theory from a given toric Calabi-Yau singularity. Our method combines information from the geometry and topology of Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, AdS/CFT, dimers, and brane tilings. We explain how the field content, quantum numbers, and superpotential of a superconformal gauge theory on D3-branes probing a toric Calabi-Yau singularity can be deduced. The infinite family of toric singularities with known horizon Sasaki-Einstein manifolds L^{a,b,c} is used to illustrate these ideas. We construct the corresponding quiver gauge theories, which may be fully specified by giving a tiling of the plane by hexagons with certain gluing rules. As checks of this construction, we perform a-maximisation as well as Z-minimisation to compute the exact R-charges of an arbitrary such quiver. We also examine a number of examples in detail, including the infinite subfamily L^{a,b,a}, whose smallest member is the Suspended Pinch Point.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/01/128","title":"Gauge Theories from Toric Geometry and Brane Tilings","createdAt":"2005-12-12"}

{"abstract":"In pure N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills with gauge group SU(N), the domain walls which separate the N vacua have been argued, on the basis of string theory realizations, to be D-branes for the confining string. In a certain limit, this means that a configuration of k parallel domain walls is described by a 2+1-dimensional U(k) gauge theory. This theory has been identified by Acharya and Vafa as the U(k) gauge theory with 4 supercharges broken by a Chern-Simons term of level N in such a way that 2 supercharges are preserved. We argue further that the gauge coupling of the domain wall gauge theory goes like g^2 ~ Lambda/N, for large N. In the case of two domain walls, we show that the U(2) world-volume theory generates a quadratic potential on the Coulomb branch at two loops in perturbation theory which is consistent with there being a supersymmetric bound state of the two wall system. A mass gap of order Lambda/N is generated around the supersymmetric minimum and we estimate the size of the bound-state to be order Lambda/ \\sqrt N. At large distance the potential reaches a constant that can qualitatively account for the binding energy of the two walls even though stringy effects are not, strictly speaking, decoupled.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/07/043","title":"Sitting on the Domain Walls of N=1 Super Yang-Mills","createdAt":"2005-05-24"}

However, the details of the Hagedorn transition turn out to depend critically on the precise manner in which a zero-temperature string theory is extrapolated to finite temperature. In this paper, we argue that for broad classes of closed string theories, the traditional Hagedorn transition is completely absent when the correct extrapolation is used. However, we also argue that there is an alternative ``re-identified'' Hagedorn transition which is triggered by the thermal winding excitations of a different, ``effective'' tachyonic string ground state. These arguments allow us to re-identify the Hagedorn temperature for heterotic strings. Moreover, we find that all tachyon-free closed string models in ten dimensions share the same (revised) Hagedorn temperature, resulting in a universal Hagedorn temperature for both Type II and heterotic strings.

Although, in general, our star product is nonassociative, we prove that it is associative to the first order in the deformation parameter. We show that our model reproduces the N=1/2 theory in the appropriate limit. Essentially, we find the N=1/2 theory and a conjugate copy. As in the N=1/2 theory, a reparameterization of the gauge parameter, vector superfield and chiral superfield are necessary to write standard C-independent gauge theory.

The universal open string tachyon of decaying non-BPS D-brane configurations is proposed to drive eternal topological inflation. Flux-induced `warping' can provide the small slow-roll parameters needed for successful inflation. Constraints on the parameter space leading to sufficient number of e-folds, exit from inflation, density perturbations and stabilization of the Kahler modulus are investigated. The conditions are difficult to satisfy in Klebanov-Strassler throats but can be satisfied in T^3 fibrations and other generic Calabi-Yau manifolds. This requires large volume and magnetic fluxes on the D-brane. The end of inflation may or may not lead to cosmic strings depending on the original non-BPS configuration. A careful investigation of initial conditions leading to a phenomenologically viable model for inflation is carried out.

In the Minkowski case some combinations of real moduli remain undetermined, whereas all can be stabilized in the AdS solutions. Many flux parameters are available which are unconstrained by RR tadpole cancellation conditions allowing to locate the minima at large volume and small dilaton. We also find that in AdS supersymmetric vacua with metric fluxes, the overall flux contribution to RR tadpoles can vanish or have opposite sign to that of D6-branes, allowing for new model-building possibilities. In particular, we construct the first N=1 supersymmetric intersecting D6-brane models with MSSM-like spectrum and with all closed string moduli stabilized. Some axion-like fields remain undetermined but they are precisely required to give St\\\"uckelberg masses to (potentially anomalous) U(1) brane fields.

The case of a single chiral superfield gives rise to splitting of the NLSM potentials, whereas the case of several chiral superfields results in smearing (or fuzziness) of the NLSM potentials, while both effects are controlled by the auxiliary fields. We eliminate the auxiliary fields by solving their algebraic equations of motion, and demonstrate that the results are dependent upon whether the auxiliary integrations responsible for the fuzziness are performed before or after elimination of the auxiliary fields.

{"abstract":"The M(3,p) minimal models are reconsidered from the point of view of the extended algebra whose generators are the energy-momentum tensor and the primary field \\phi_{2,1} of dimension $(p-2)/4$. Within this framework, we provide a quasi-particle description of these models, in which all states are expressed solely in terms of the \\phi_{2,1}-modes. More precisely, we show that all the states can be written in terms of \\phi_{2,1}-type highest-weight states and their phi_{2,1}-descendants. We further demonstrate that the conformal dimension of these highest-weight states can be calculated from the \\phi_{2,1} commutation relations, the highest-weight conditions and associativity. For the simplest models (p=5,7), the full spectrum is explicitly reconstructed along these lines. For $p$ odd, the commutation relations between the \\phi_{2,1} modes take the form of infinite sums, i.e., of generalized commutation relations akin to parafermionic models. In that case, an unexpected operator, generalizing the Witten index, is unravelled in the OPE of \\phi_{2,1} with itself. A quasi-particle basis formulated in terms of the sole \\phi_{1,2} modes is studied for all allowed values of p. We argue that it is governed by jagged-type partitions further subject a difference 2 condition at distance 2.

{"abstract":"In bosonic closed string field theory the \"tachyon potential\" is a potential for the tachyon, the dilaton, and an infinite set of massive fields. Earlier computations of the potential did not include the dilaton and the critical point formed by the quadratic and cubic interactions was destroyed by the quartic tachyon term. We include the dilaton contributions to the potential and find that a critical point survives and appears to become more shallow. We are led to consider the existence of a closed string tachyon vacuum, a critical point with zero action that represents a state where space-time ceases to be dynamical. Some evidence for this interpretation is found from the study of the coupled metric-dilaton-tachyon effective field equations, which exhibit rolling solutions in which the dilaton runs to strong coupling and the Einstein metric undergoes collapse.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/09/054","title":"A Closed String Tachyon Vacuum ?","createdAt":"2005-07-26"}

The Lagrange structure is shown to admit a natural BRST description which is used to construct an AKSZ-type topological sigma-model. The dynamics of this sigma-model in $d+1$ dimensions, being localized on the boundary, are proved to be equivalent to the original theory in $d$ dimensions. As the topological sigma-model has a well defined action, it is path-integral quantized in the usual way that results in quantization of the original (not necessarily Lagrangian) theory.

{"abstract":"Most of the known models describing the fundamental interactions have a gauge freedom. In the standard path integral, it is necessary to \"fix the gauge\" in order to avoid integrating over unphysical degrees of freedom. Gauge independence might then become a tricky issue, especially when the structure of the gauge symmetries is intricate. In the modern approach to this question, it is BRST invariance that effectively implements gauge invariance. This set of lectures briefly reviews some key ideas underlying the BRST-antifield formalism, which yields a systematic procedure to path-integrate any type of gauge system, while (usually) manifestly preserving spacetime covariance. The quantized theory possesses a global invariance under the so-called BRST transformation, which is nilpotent of order two. The cohomology of the BRST differential is the central element that controls the physics. Its relationship with the observables is sketched and explained. How anomalies appear in the \"quantum master equation\" of the antifield formalism is also discussed.

In conventional four dimensional cosmology one can calculate the effect of scalar metric perturbations as slow-roll corrections to the evolution of a massless free field in de Sitter spacetime.

If inflaton fluctuations on a four dimensional brane embedded in a five dimensional bulk spacetime are studied to first-order in slow-roll then we recover the usual conserved curvature perturbation on super-horizon scales. But on small scales, at high energies, we find that the coupling to the bulk metric perturbations cannot be neglected, leading to a modified amplitude of vacuum oscillations on small scales.

This quantization corresponds to the quantization of the black hole angular momentum, as expected from the dual CFT description. Note, however, that we recover this result by analyzing the physics inside the horizon and near the singularity. The spacetime under consideration has no AdS boundary, and we are therefore not using any assumption regarding a possible dual formulation.

{"abstract":"We study the scalar potential in supersymmetric (orientifolded) Calabi Yau compactifications of Type IIB theory. We present a new mechanism to stabilize all closed string moduli at leading order in \\alpha^{'} by introducing consistently fluxes. As usual we consider the dilaton and the complex structure moduli stabilized by turning on three-form fluxes that couple to the F-part of the scalar potential. Kahler moduli get fixed by the combined action of the flux-induced scalar masses with magnetic fields of the open string sector, and Fayet-Illiopoulos terms. For supersymmetric three-form fluxes the model is N=1, otherwise the mass terms are the scalar soft breaking terms of the SM fields. For the case of imaginary self dual three-form fluxes (ISD), the mass terms are positive and the minimum at the potential is at exactly zero energy. We argue that, under generic assumptions, this is a general mechanism for the full stabilization of closed string moduli. The vacua depend explicitly on the fluxes introduced in the manifold.

In the celebrated Plebanski formalism, the constraints connecting topological field theories and gravity are imposed in space-times with trivial topology.

In this work we show how to construct topological gravity in a scenario containing one extra dimension and a delta-function like 3-brane which naturally emerges from a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry.

{"abstract":"Space-time measurements and gravitational experiments are made by using objects, matter fields or particles and their mutual relationships. As a consequence, any operationally meaningful assertion about space-time is in fact an assertion about the degrees of freedom of the matter (\\emph{i.e} non gravitational) fields; those, say for definiteness, of the Standard Model of particle physics. As for any quantum theory, the dynamics of the matter fields can be described in terms of a unitary evolution of a state vector in a Hilbert space. By writing the Hilbert space as a generic tensor product of \"subsystems\" we analyse the evolution of a state vector on an information theoretical basis and attempt to recover the usual space-time relations from the information exchanges between these subsystems. We consider generic interacting second quantized models with a finite number of fermionic degrees of freedom and characterize on physical grounds the tensor product structure associated with the class of \"localized systems\" and therefore with \"position\". We find that in the case of free theories no space-time relation is operationally definable. On the contrary, by applying the same procedure to the simple interacting model of a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain we recover the tensor product structure usually associated with \"position\".

Generically, at two loops, the leading singular behavior of a scalar double box integral with seven propagators is captured by a hepta-cut. However, it turns out that a certain class of such integrals has an additional propagator-like singularity. One can then formally cut the new propagator to obtain an octa-cut which localizes the cut integral just as a quadruple cut does at one-loop. This immediately gives the coefficient of the scalar double box integral as a product of six tree-level amplitudes.

{"abstract":"The negative energy density of Casimir systems appears to violate general relativity energy conditions. However, one cannot test the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) using standard calculations for perfectly reflecting plates, because the null geodesic would have to pass through the plates, where the calculation breaks down. To avoid this problem, we compute the contribution to ANEC for a geodesic that passes through a hole in a single plate. We consider both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in two and three space dimensions. We use a Babinet's principle argument to reduce the problem to a complementary finite disk correction to the perfect mirror result, which we then compute using scattering theory in elliptical and spheroidal coordinates. In the Dirichlet case, we find that the positive correction due to the hole overwhelms the negative contribution of the infinite plate. In the Neumann case, where the infinite plate gives a positive contribution, the hole contribution is smaller in magnitude, so again ANEC is obeyed. These results can be extended to the case of two plates in the limits of large and small hole radii. This system thus provides another example of a situation where ANEC turns out to be obeyed when one might expect it to be violated.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.025013","title":"Plate with a hole obeys the averaged null energy condition","createdAt":"2005-11-07"}

{"abstract":"Gauge fields have a natural metric interpretation in terms of horizontal distance. The latest, also called Carnot-Caratheodory or subriemannian distance, is by definition the length of the shortest horizontal path between points, that is to say the shortest path whose tangent vector is everywhere horizontal with respect to the gauge connection. In noncommutative geometry all the metric information is encoded within the Dirac operator D. In the classical case, i.e. commutative, Connes's distance formula allows to extract from D the geodesic distance on a riemannian spin manifold. In the case of a gauge theory with a gauge field A, the geometry of the associated U(n)-vector bundle is described by the covariant Dirac operator D+A. What is the distance encoded within this operator ? It was expected that the noncommutative geometry distance d defined by a covariant Dirac operator was intimately linked to the Carnot-Caratheodory distance dh defined by A. In this paper we precise this link, showing that the equality of d and dh strongly depends on the holonomy of the connection. Quite interestingly we exhibit an elementary example, based on a 2 torus, in which the noncommutative distance has a very simple expression and simultaneously avoids the main drawbacks of the riemannian metric (no discontinuity of the derivative of the distance function at the cut-locus) and of the subriemannian one (memory of the structure of the fiber).","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null,"Mathematical Physics","Quantum Algebra"],"doi":"10.1007/s00220-006-0001-9","title":"Carnot-Caratheodory metric and gauge fluctuation in Noncommutative Geometry","createdAt":"2007-03-18"}

{"abstract":"We construct a manifestly gauge invariant Exact Renormalisation Group (ERG) whose form is suitable for computation in SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, beyond one-loop. An effective cutoff is implemented by embedding the physical SU(N) theory in a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) Yang-Mills theory. To facilitate computations within this scheme, which proceed at every step without fixing the gauge, we develop a set of diagrammatic techniques. As an initial test of the formalism, the one-loop SU(N) Yang-Mills beta-function, beta_1, is computed, and the standard, universal answer is reproduced. It is recognised that the computational technique can be greatly simplified. Using these simplifications, a partial proof is given that, to all orders in perturbation theory, the explicit dependence of perturbative $\\beta$-function coefficients, beta_n, on certain non-universal elements of the manifestly gauge invariant ERG cancels out. This partial proof yields an extremely compact, diagrammatic form for the surviving contributions to arbitrary beta_n, up to a set of terms which are yet to be dealt with. The validity of the compact expression is reliant on an unproven assertion at the third loop order and above. Starting from the compact expression for beta_n, we specialise to beta_2 and explicitly construct the set of terms yet to be dealt with. From the resulting diagrammatic expression for beta_2, we extract a numerical coefficient which, in the limit that the coupling of one of the unphysical regulator fields is tuned to zero, yields the standard, universal answer.

The purpose of this article is to explore the extent to which this idea may be extended to the quantum sine-Gordon model and how the striking features of the classical model may translate to the quantum version. Assuming a positive defect parameter there are two types of defect. One type, carrying even charge, is stable, but the other type, carrying odd charge, is unstable and may be considered as a resonant bound state of a soliton and a stable defect. The scattering of solitons with defects is considered in detail, as is the scattering of breathers, and in all cases the jump-defect is purely transmitting. One surprising discovery concerns the lightest breather. Its transmission factor is independent of the bulk coupling - a property susceptible to a perturbative check, but not shared with any of the other breathers. It is argued that classical jump-defects can move and some comments are made concerning their quantum scattering matrix.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/08/023","title":"Some aspects of jump-defects in the quantum sine-Gordon model","createdAt":"2005-08-03"}

In a mixed anomaly-D mediated scenario, the scalars have masses from D-mediation, whereas gaugino masses are generated by anomaly mediation.

A new dimensional constant which characterizes one act of interaction is introduced and estimated. Non-forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional relaxation of any photonic flux. It gives a possibility of another interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. Of course, all of these facts may implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm.

If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the nature, than an existence of black holes contradicts to Einstein's equivalence principle. It is shown that in this approach the two fundamental constants - Hubble's and Newton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The theoretical value of the Hubble constant is computed. In this approach, every massive body would be decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the Pioneer 10 anomaly. It is shown that the predicted and observed values of deceleration are in good agreement. Some unsolved problems are discussed, so as possibilities to verify some conjectures in laser-based experiments.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0506189","title":"Gravitons as super-strong interacting particles, and low-energy quantum gravity","createdAt":"2006-01-28"}

The results above the critical point are nicely reproduced by the all order calculations in perturbation theory.

{"abstract":"A general method exists for studying Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories, as well as Euclidean quantum gravity, at one-loop level on manifolds with boundary. In the latter case, boundary conditions on metric perturbations h can be chosen to be completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, to preserve the invariance group of the theory and BRST symmetry. In the de Donder gauge, however, the resulting boundary-value problem for the Laplace type operator acting on h is known to be self-adjoint but not strongly elliptic. The present paper shows that, on the Euclidean four-ball, only the scalar part of perturbative modes for quantum gravity is affected by the lack of strong ellipticity. Interestingly, three sectors of the scalar-perturbation problem remain elliptic, while lack of strong ellipticity is confined to the remaining fourth sector. The integral representation of the resulting zeta-function asymptotics on the Euclidean four-ball is also obtained; this remains regular at the origin by virtue of a peculiar spectral identity obtained by the authors. There is therefore encouraging evidence in favour of the zeta(0) value with fully diff-invariant boundary conditions remaining well defined, at least on the four-ball, although severe technical obstructions remain in general.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0506223","title":"A New Spectral Cancellation in Quantum Gravity","createdAt":"2006-01-03"}

Using the results of [2] we show that given two \"shape deformation\" functions, and the dilaton, one can construct a Riemann surface obtained via Weierstrass representation for the conformal immersion of a surface in R^l, for a suitable l, with the condition of having conformal immersion being a quadric in CP^{l-1}.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1002/prop.200510269","title":"Uplifting the Iwasawa","createdAt":"2005-09-12"}

This corrects recent claims that boundary CFT quantities satisfying the first law may only be obtained using bulk quantities measured with respect to a certain frame rotating at infinity, and which therefore do not satisfy the first law. We show that the bulk black hole thermodynamic variables, or equivalently therefore the boundary CFT variables, do not always satisfy a Cardy-Verlinde type formula, but they do always satisfy an AdS-Bekenstein bound. The universal validity of the Bekenstein bound is a consequence of the more fundamental cosmic censorship bound, which we find to hold in all cases examined. We also find that at fixed entropy, the temperature of a rotating black hole is bounded above by that of a non-rotating black hole, in four and five dimensions, but not in six or more dimensions.

When passing through the singularity on the deformed side, the O-plane charge generally jumps by the class of the vanishing cycle. To decide which classical configurations are dynamically connected, we construct the quantum moduli space by lifting the orientifold to M-theory as well as by looking at the superpotential.

{"abstract":"An anthropic understanding of the cosmological constant requires that the vacuum energy at late time scans from one patch of the universe to another. If the vacuum energy during inflation also scans, the various patches of the universe acquire exponentially differing volumes. In a generic landscape with slow-roll inflation, we find that this gives a steeply varying probability distribution for the normalization of the primordial density perturbations, resulting in an exponentially small fraction of observers measuring the COBE value of 10^-5. Inflationary landscapes should avoid this \"\\sigma problem\", and we explore features that can allow them to do that. One possibility is that, prior to slow-roll inflation, the probability distribution for vacua is extremely sharply peaked, selecting essentially a single anthropically allowed vacuum. Such a selection could occur in theories of eternal inflation. A second possibility is that the inflationary landscape has a special property: although scanning leads to patches with volumes that differ exponentially, the value of the density perturbation does not vary under this scanning. This second case is preferred over the first, partly because a flat inflaton potential can result from anthropic selection, and partly because the anthropic selection of a small cosmological constant is more successful.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.123506","title":"Density Perturbations and the Cosmological Constant from Inflationary Landscapes","createdAt":"2005-06-27"}

For the standard sign and specific values of the parameters corresponding to solutions with positive mass the singularity is dressed (in the sense that itself constitutes an horizon). The space-time curvatures can be both positive or negative depending on the dominance of the scalar or topologically massive matter. The Chern-Simons term is responsible for interesting features, besides only allowing for rotating solutions, it imposes restrictive bounds on the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ such that it belongs to a positive interval and is switch on and off by the topological mass $m^2$. Furthermore the charge, angular momentum and mass of the particle solution are expressed uniquely as functions of the ratio between the cosmological constant and the topological mass squared $x=\\Lambda/m^2$.

An example is considered, for which we construct the Bogomol'nyi bound and find some explicit solutions. We show that violation of both Lorentz and CPT symmetries induces the appearance of an asymmetry between defects and anti-defects, including the presence of linearly stable solutions with negative energy density in their outer side.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.73.065015","title":"Defect Structures in Lorentz and CPT Violating Scenarios","createdAt":"2005-12-09"}

{"abstract":"The N=4 SuperYang--Mills theory is covariantly determined by a U(1) \\times SU(2) \\subset SL(2,R) \\times SU(2) internal symmetry and two scalar and one vector BRST topological symmetry operators. This determines an off-shell closed sector of N=4 SuperYang-Mills, with 6 generators, which is big enough to fully determine the theory, in a Lorentz covariant way. This reduced algebra derives from horizontality conditions in four dimensions. The horizontality conditions only depend on the geometry of the Yang-Mills fields. They also descend from a genuine horizontality condition in eight dimensions. In fact, the SL(2,R) symmetry is induced by a dimensional reduction from eight to seven dimensions, which establishes a ghost-antighost symmetry, while the SU(2) symmetry occurs by dimensional reduction from seven to four dimensions. When the four dimensional manifold is hyperKahler, one can perform a twist operation that defines the N=4 supersymmetry and its SL(2,H)\\sim SU(4) R-symmetry in flat space. (For defining a TQFT on a more general four manifold, one can use the internal SU(2)-symmetry and redefine a Lorentz SO(4) invariance). These results extend in a covariant way the light cone property that the N=4 SuperYang-Mills theory is actually determined by only 8 independent generators, instead of the 16 generators that occur in the physical representation of the superPoincare algebra. The topological construction disentangles the off-shell closed sector of the (twisted) maximally supersymmetric theory from the (irrelevant) sector that closes only modulo equations of motion.

To guarantee the stability of the vacuum, we introduce a Dirac sea `hole' theory of quantization for gravity as well as the standard model. The vacuum is defined to be fully occupied by negative energy particles with a hole in the Dirac sea, corresponding to an anti-particle. We postulate that the negative energy bosons in the vacuum satisfy a para-statistics that leads to a para-Pauli exclusion principle for the negative energy bosons in the vacuum, while the positive energy bosons in the Hilbert space obey the usual Bose-Einstein statistics. This assures that the vacuum is stable for both fermions and bosons.

The string theory background we use was found in hep-th/0503201 from the AdS_5 x S5 by a combination of T-dualities and shifts of angular coordinates. It depends on three real parameters gamma_i which determine the shape of the deformed 5-sphere. The dual gauge theory has the same field content as N=4 SYM theory, but with scalar and Yukawa interactions ``deformed'' by gamma_i-dependent phases. The special case of equal deformation parameters gamma_i=gamma corresponds to the N=1 supersymmetric deformation. We compare the energies of semiclassical strings with three large angular momenta to the 1-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding gauge-theory scalar operators and find that they match as it was the case in the SU(3) sector of the standard AdS/CFT duality. In the supersymmetric case of equal gamma_i this extends the result of our previous work (hep-th/0503192) from the 2-spin to the 3-spin sector. This extension turns out to be quite nontrivial. To match the corresponding low-energy effective ``Landau-Lifshitz'' actions on the string theory and the gauge theory sides one is to make a special choice of the spin chain Hamiltonian representing the 1-loop gauge theory dilatation operator. This choice is adapted to low-energy approximation, i.e. it allows one to capture the right vacuum states and the macroscopic spin wave sector of states of the spin chain in the continuum coherent state effective action.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.10.004","title":"Gauge-string duality for (non)supersymmetric deformations of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory","createdAt":"2005-07-24"}

{"abstract":"Casimir effect in most general terms may be understood as a backreaction of a quantum system causing an adiabatic change of the external conditions under which it is placed. This paper is the second installment of a work scrutinizing this effect with the use of algebraic methods in quantum theory. The general scheme worked out in the first part is applied here to the discussion of particular models. We consider models of the quantum scalar field subject to external interaction with ``softened'' Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on two parallel planes. We show that the case of electromagnetic field with softened perfect conductor conditions on the planes may be reduced to the other two. The ``softening'' is implemented on the level of the dynamics, and is not imposed ad hoc, as is usual in most treatments, on the level of observables. We calculate formulas for the backreaction energy in these models. We find that the common belief that for electromagnetic field the backreaction force tends to the strict Casimir formula in the limit of ``removed cutoff'' is not confirmed by our strict analysis. The formula is model dependent and the Casimir value is merely a term in the asymptotic expansion of the formula in inverse powers of the distance of the planes. Typical behaviour of the energy for large separation of the plates in the class of models considered is a quadratic fall-of. Depending on the details of the ``softening'' of the boundary conditions the backreaction force may become repulsive for large separations.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1007/s00023-005-0249-1","title":"Quantum backreaction (Casimir) effect.

{"abstract":"We study propagation of D0-brane in two-dimensional Lorentzian black hole backgrounds by the method of boundary conformal field theory of SL(2,R)/U(1) supercoset at level k. Typically, such backgrounds arise as near-horizon geometries of k coincident non-extremal NS5-branes, where 1/k measures curvature of the backgrounds in string unit and hence size of string worldsheet effects. At classical level, string worldsheet effects are suppressed and D0-brane propagation in the Lorentzian black hole geometry is simply given by the Wick rotation of D1-brane contour in the Euclidean black hole geometry. Taking account of string worldsheet effects, boundary state of the Lorentzian D0-brane is formally constructible via Wick rotation from that of the Euclidean D1-brane. However, the construction is subject to ambiguities in boundary conditions. We propose exact boundary states describing the D0-brane, and clarify physical interpretations of various boundary states constructed from different boundary conditions. As it falls into the black hole, the D0-brane radiates off to the horizon and to the infinity. From the boundary states constructed, we compute physical observables of such radiative process. We find that part of the radiation to infinity is in effective thermal distribution at the Hawking temperature. We also find that part of the radiation to horizon is in the Hagedorn distribution, dominated by massive, highly non-relativistic closed string states, much like the tachyon matter. Remarkably, such distribution emerges only after string worldsheet effects are taken exactly into account. From these results, we observe that nature of the radiation distribution changes dramatically across the conifold geometry k=1 (k=3 for the bosonic case), exposing the `string - black hole transition' therein.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/09/020","title":"D-Brane Propagation in Two-Dimensional Black Hole Geometries","createdAt":"2006-05-01"}

{"abstract":"Although Quantum field theory has been very successful in explaining experiment, there are two aspects of the theory that remain quite troubling. One is the no-interaction result proved in Haag's theorem. The other is the existence of infinite perturbation expansion terms that need to be absorbed into theoretically unknown but experimentally measurable quantities like charge and mass -- i.e. renormalization. Here it will be shown that the two problems may be related. A \"natural\" method of eliminating the renormalization problem also sidesteps Haag's theorem automatically. Existing renormalization schemes can at best be considered a temporary fix as perturbation theory assumes expansion terms to be \"small\" -- and infinite terms are definitely not so (even if they are renormalized away). String theories may be expected to help the situation because the infinities can be traced to the point-nature of particles. However, string theories have their own problems arising from the extra space dimensions required. Here a more directly physical remedy is suggested. Particles are modeled as extended objects (like strings). But, unlike strings, they are composites of a finite number of constituents each of which resides in the normal 4-dimensional space-time. The constituents are bound together by a manifestly covariant confining potential. This approach no longer requires infinite renormalizations.

{"abstract":"Following recent fit of supernovae data to Brans-Dicke theory which favours the model with $\\omega = - 3/2$ \\cite{fabris} we discuss the status of this special case of Brans-Dicke cosmology in both isotropic and anisotropic framework. It emerges that the limit $\\omega = -3/2$ is consistent only with the vacuum field equations and it makes such a Brans-Dicke theory conformally invariant. Then it is an example of the conformal relativity theory which allows the invariance with respect to conformal transformations of the metric. Besides, Brans-Dicke theory with $\\omega = -3/2$ gives a border between a standard scalar field model and a ghost/phantom model. In this paper we show that in $\\omega = -3/2$ Brans-Dicke theory, i.e., in the conformal relativity there are no isotropic Friedmann solutions of non-zero spatial curvature except for $k=-1$ case. Further we show that this $k=-1$ case, after the conformal transformation into the Einstein frame, is just the Milne universe and, as such, it is equivalent to Minkowski spacetime. It generally means that only flat models are fully consistent with the field equations. On the other hand, it is shown explicitly that the anisotropic non-zero spatial curvature models of Kantowski-Sachs type are admissible in $\\omega = -3/2$ Brans-Dicke theory. It then seems that an additional scale factor which appears in anisotropic models gives an extra deegre of freedom and makes it less restrictive than in an isotropic Friedmann case.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics",null],"doi":"10.1002/andp.200610230","title":"The conformal status of $\\omega=-3/2$ Brans-Dicke cosmology","createdAt":"2006-01-06"}

The BRST charges of the theories are the superspace Killing vectors (the generators of global supersymmetry) on the background with reduced holonomy G_2. In the absence of spinning formulations of supermembranes, the starting point is an N=2 target space supersymmetric membrane in seven euclidean dimensions. The reduction of the holonomy group implies a twisting of the rotations in the tangent bundle of the branes with ``R-symmetry'' rotations in the normal bundle, in contrast to the ordinary spinning formulation of topological strings, where twisting is performed with internal U(1) currents of the N=(2,2) superconformal algebra.

The divergences that arise in a perturbative treatment of the theory are of two forms: those associated with the properties of a field propagating through the bulk of space-time, which are unaffected by the choice of the initial state, and those that result from summing over the short-distance structure of the initial state. We show that the former have the same renormalization and produce the same subsequent scale dependence as for the standard vacuum state, while the latter correspond to divergences that are localized at precisely the initial time hypersurface on which the state is defined. This class of divergences is therefore renormalized by adding initial-boundary counterterms, which render all of the perturbative corrections small and finite. Initial states that approach the standard vacuum at short distances require, at worst, relevant or marginal boundary counterterms. States that differ from the vacuum at distances below that at which any new, potentially trans-Planckian, physics becomes important are renormalized with irrelevant boundary counterterms.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0507081","title":"An effective theory of initial conditions in inflation","createdAt":"2005-07-07"}

{"abstract":"The possibility that the scale-invariant inflationary spectrum may be modified due to the hidden assumptions about the Planck scale physics -- dubbed as trans-Planckian inflation -- has received considerable attention. To mimic the possible trans-Planckian effects, among various models, modified dispersion relations have been popular in the literature. In almost all the earlier analyzes, unlike the canonical scalar field driven inflation, the trans-Planckian effects are introduced to the scalar/tensor perturbation equations in an ad hoc manner -- without calculating the stress-tensor of the cosmological perturbations from the covariant Lagrangian. In this work, we perform the gauge-invariant cosmological perturbations for the single-scalar field inflation with the Jacobson-Corley dispersion relation by computing the fluctuations of all the fields including the unit time-like vector field which defines a preferred rest frame. We show that: (i) The non-linear effects introduce corrections only to the perturbed energy density. The corrections to the energy density vanish in the super-Hubble scales. (ii) The scalar perturbations, in general, are not purely adiabatic. (iii) The equation of motion of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable corresponding to the inflaton field is different than those presumed in the earlier analyzes. (iv) The tensor perturbation equation remains unchanged. We perform the classical analysis for the resultant system of equations and also compute the power-spectrum of the scalar perturbations in a particular limit.

{"abstract":"We reduce the classification of all supersymmetric backgrounds of IIB supergravity to the evaluation of the Killing spinor equations and their integrability conditions, which contain the field equations, on five types of spinors. This extends the work of [hep-th/0503046] to IIB supergravity. We give the expressions of the Killing spinor equations on all five types of spinors. In this way, the Killing spinor equations become a linear system for the fluxes, geometry and spacetime derivatives of the functions that determine the Killing spinors. This system can be solved to express the fluxes in terms of the geometry and determine the conditions on the geometry of any supersymmetric background. Similarly, the integrability conditions of the Killing spinor equations are turned into a linear system. This can be used to determine the field equations that are implied by the Killing spinor equations for any supersymmetric background. We show that these linear systems simplify for generic backgrounds with maximal and half-maximal number of $H$-invariant Killing spinors, $H\\subset Spin(9,1)$. In the maximal case, the Killing spinor equations factorize, whereas in the half-maximal case they do not.

{"abstract":"In a previous publication we have shown that the gauge theory of relativistic 3-Branes can be formulated in a conformally invariant way if the embedding space is six-dimensional. The implementation of conformal invariance requires the use of a modified measure, independent of the metric in the action. We here generalize the theory to include conformal invariance breaking and a dynamical scalar field with a non-trivial potential. The non conformal invariance contribution can be interpreted as originating from a continious \"non ideal brane fluid\" that exists between two singular branes. The scalar field potential also breaks the conformal invariance. At singular brane locations, conformal invariance is restored and the dynamics of the scalar field is frozen at a certain fixed value of the scalar field which depends on an arbitrary integration constant. Spontaneous Symmetry breaking can take place due to such boundary condition without the need of invoking tachyonic mass terms for the scalar field. In these Brane-world scenarios, zero 4-D cosmological constant is achieved without the need of invoking a fine tuned cosmological constant in 6D. Thus, no ``old'' cosmological constant problem appears.

Indeed, if our world were embedded into an odd-dimensional space, then the full theory would be automatically anomaly free.

We demonstrate that in such a theory parallel electric and magnetic fields get modified. In particular, this happens for any particle possessing both electric charge and magnetic moment.

The power-law tails at asymptotically late times for odd-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes does not depend on $\\alpha$, even though the black hole metric contains $\\alpha$ as a new parameter. The corrections to quasinormal spectrum due to Gauss-Bonnet coupling is not small and should not be neglected. For the limit of near extremal value of the (positive) cosmological constant and pure de Sitter and anti-de Sitter modes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity we have found analytical expressions.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics",null],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.084006","title":"Scalar field evolution in Gauss-Bonnet black holes","createdAt":"2005-09-28"}

In order to make contact to the spinning string energies we then study the thermodynamic limit of the one-loop gauge theory Bethe equations and demonstrate the matching with the folded and closed string result at this loop order. Finally the known gauge theory results at higher-loop orders are reviewed and the associated long-range spin chain Bethe ansatz is introduced, leading to an asymptotic all-loop conjecture for the gauge theory Bethe equations. This uncovers discrepancies at the three-loop order between gauge theory scaling dimensions and string theory energies and the implications of this are discussed. Along the way we comment on further developments and generalizations of the subject and point to the relevant literature.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.12942/lrr-2005-9","title":"Spinning strings and integrable spin chains in the AdS/CFT correspondence","createdAt":"2005-08-05"}

This submanifold is defined by the fixed point set of a circle action rotating the monopoles in the plane. To derive this result we present a D-brane construction of domain walls, yielding a description of their dynamics in terms of truncated Nahm equations.

{"abstract":"This article first reviews the calculation of the N = 1 effective action for generic type IIA and type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds in the presence of background fluxes by using a Kaluza-Klein reduction. The Kahler potential, the gauge kinetic functions and the flux-induced superpotential are determined in terms of geometrical data of the Calabi-Yau orientifold and the background fluxes. As a new result, it is shown that the chiral description directly relates to Hitchin's generalized geometry encoded by special odd and even forms on a threefold, whereas a dual formulation with several linear multiplets makes contact to the underlying N = 2 special geometry. In type IIB setups, the flux-potentials can be expressed in terms of superpotentials, D-terms and, generically, a massive linear multiplet.

Thus at late times only the unitary information preserving path integrals over trivial topologies will contribute.

{"abstract":"In this paper we analyze the structure of supersymmetric vacua in compactifications of the heterotic string on certain manifolds with SU(3) structure. We first study the effective theories obtained from compactifications on half-flat manifolds and show that solutions which stabilise the moduli at acceptable values are hard to find. We then derive the effective theories associated with compactification on generalised half-flat manifolds. It is shown that these effective theories are consistent with four-dimensional N=1 supergravity and that the superpotential can be obtained by a Gukov-Vafa-Witten type formula. Within these generalised models, we find consistent supersymmetric (AdS) vacua at weak gauge coupling, provided we allow for general internal gauge bundles. In simple cases we perform a counting of such vacua and find that a fraction of about 1/1000 leads to a gauge coupling consistent with gauge unification.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/03/005","title":"Moduli Stabilisation in Heterotic String Compactifications","createdAt":"2006-02-24"}

These worldline instantons are classical solutions to the Euclidean worldline loop equations of motion, and are closed spacetime loops parametrized by the proper-time. Specifically, we compute the imaginary part of the one loop effective action in scalar QED using ``worldline instantons'', for a wide class of inhomogeneous electric field backgrounds. We treat both time dependent and space dependent electric fields, and note that temporal inhomogeneities tend to shrink the instanton loops, while spatial inhomogeneities tend to expand them. This corresponds to temporal inhomogeneities tending to enhance local pair production, with spatial inhomogeneities tending to suppress local pair production. We also show how the worldline instanton technique extends to spinor QED.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.105004","title":"Worldline Instantons and Pair Production in Inhomogeneous Fields","createdAt":"2005-11-07"}

{"abstract":"Recent one-loop calculations of certain supergravity-mediated quantum corrections in supersymmetric brane-world models employ either the component formulation (hep-th/0305184) or the superfield formalism with only half of the bulk supersymmetry manifestly realized (hep-th/0305169 and hep-th/0411216). There are reasons to expect, however, that 5D supergraphs provide a more efficient setup to deal with these and more involved (in particular, higher-loop) calculations. As a first step toward elaborating such supergraph techniques, we develop in this letter a manifestly supersymmetric formulation for 5D globally supersymmetric theories with eight supercharges. Simple rules are given to reduce 5D superspace actions to a hybrid form which keeps manifest only the 4D, N=1 Poincare supersymmetry. (Previously, such hybrid actions were carefully worked out by rewriting the component actions in terms of simple superfields). To demonstrate the power of this formalism for model building applications, two families of off-shell supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models in five dimensions are presented (including those with cotangent bundles of Kahler manifolds as target spaces). We elaborate, trying to make our presentation maximally clear and self-contained, on the techniques of 5D harmonic and projective superspaces used at some stages in this letter.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/02/038","title":"On Five-dimensional Superspaces","createdAt":"2006-02-20"}

{"abstract":"We derive the exact gravitational field of a relativistic particle localized on an $AdS$ 3-brane, with curvature radius $\\ell$, in $AdS_5$ bulk with radius $L$. The solution is a gravitational shock wave. We use it to explore the dynamics of locally localized tensor gravitons over a wide range of scales. At distances below $L$ the shock wave looks exactly like the $5D$ $GR$ solution. Beyond $L$ the solution approximates very closely the shock wave in 4D $AdS$ space all the way out to distances $\\ell^3/L^2$ along the brane. At distances between $L$ and $\\ell$, the effective 4D graviton is a composite built of the ultralight mode and heavier gravitons, whereas between $\\ell$ and $\\ell^3/L^2$ it is just the ultralight mode. Finally beyond $\\ell^3/L^2$ the shock reveals a glimpse of the fifth dimension, since the ultralight mode wave function decays to zero at the rate inherited from the full $5D$ geometry. We obtain the precise bulk-side formula for the 4D Planck mass, defined as the coupling of the ultralight mode, in terms of the $5D$ Planck mass and the curvature radii. It includes higher-order corrections in $L/\\ell$, and reduces to the RS2 formula in the limit $\\ell \\to \\infty$. We discuss $AdS/CFT$ interpretation of these results, and argue that the spatial variation of the effective gravitational coupling read from the shock wave amplitude corresponds to RG running driven by quantum effects in the dual $CFT$.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics",null,"High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/08/070","title":"Locally Localized Gravity: The Inside Story","createdAt":"2005-07-20"}

{"abstract":"The aim of this thesis is to study the isopectral deformations from the point of view of Alain Connes' noncommutative geometry. This class of quantum spaces constituts a curved space generalisation of Moyal planes and noncommutative tori. First of all, we look at the construction of non-unital spectral triples, for which we propose modified axioms. We then check that Moyal planes fit into this axiomatic framework, and give the keypoints for the construction of non-unital spectral triples from generic non-compact isospectral deformations. To this end, numerous analytical tools on non-compact Riemannian manifolds are developped. Thanks to Dixmier traces computations, we show that their spectral and classical dimensions coincide. In a second time, we study certain features of quantum fields theory on curved isospectral deformations, with a particular view on the ultraviolet infrared mixing phenomenon. We show its intrinsic nature for all such quantum spaces (compacts or not, periodic or not deformations), and we study its consequences on the renormalisability. In particular, the behaviour of Green functions of the planar and non-planar sectors is understood in term of on- and off-diagonal heat kernel contributions. We also see new or inner manifestations of the UV/IR mixing, related to the geometric properties of those quantum spaces and to the arithmetic nature of the deformation parameters.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematical Physics","Operator Algebras"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0507208","title":"D\\'{e}formations isospectrales non compactes et th\\'{e}orie quantique des champs","createdAt":"2005-11-02"}

On the other hand there is overwhelming evidence that QCD and all non-abelian theories admit an effective string description. Here we review a derivation of the (intrinsic) parity-even chiral Lagrangian by requiring that the propagation of the QCD string takes place on a background where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Requiring conformal invariance leads to the equation of motion of the chiral Lagrangian. We then proceed to coupling the string degrees of freedom to external gauge fields and we recover in this way the covariant equations of motion of the gauge-invariant chiral Lagrangian at p^2 order. We consider next the parity-odd part (Wess-Zumino-Witten) action and argue that this require the introduction of the spin degrees of freedom (absent in the usual effective action treatment). We manage to reproduce the Wess-Zumino-Witten term in 2D in an unambiguous way. In 4D the situation is considerably more involved.

{"abstract":"Nonlinearly realized Abelian global symmetries can be reformulated as local shift symmetries gauged by three-form gauge fields. The anomalous symmetries of the Standard Model (such as Peccei-Quinn or $B+L$) can be dualized to local symmetries gauged by the Chern-Simons three-forms of the Standard Model gauge group. In this description the strong CP problem can be reformulated as the problem of a massless three-form field in QCD, which creates an arbitrary CP-violating constant four-form electric field in the vacuum. Both the axion as well as the massless quark solutions amount to simply Higgsing the three-form gauge field, hence screening the electric field in the vacuum. This language gives an alternative way for visualizing the physics of the axion solution as well as the degree of its vulnerability due to gravitational corrections. Any physics that can jeopardize the axion solution must take the QCD three-form out of the Higgs phase. This can only happen if the physics in question provides an additional massless three-form. The axion then Higgses one combination of the three-forms and the QCD electric field gets partially unscreened, reintroducing the strong CP problem. Gravity provides such a candidate in form of the Chern-Simons spin connection three-form, which could un-Higgs the QCD three-form in the absence of additional chiral symmetries. We also discuss analogous effects for the baryon number symmetry.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0507215","title":"Three-Form Gauging of axion Symmetries and Gravity","createdAt":"2005-07-21"}

This model arises as a consistent truncation of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a three-sphere to the lowest modes of the scalar fields. In fact, our studies mimic the current investigations concerning the integrability properties of this gauge theory. Like in the field theory we can prove the planar integrability of the SO(6) model at first perturbative order. At higher orders we restrict ourselves to the widely studied SU(2) subsector spanned by two complexified scalar fields of the theory. We show that our toy model satisfies all commonly studied integrability requirements such as degeneracies in the spectrum, existence of conserved charges and factorized scattering up to third perturbative order. These are the same qualitative features as the ones found in super Yang-Mills theory, which were enough to conjecture the all-loop integrability of that theory.

In gauge theories that have a dual description that is well approximated by a theory of gravity in a warped geometry, we propose that plasma-balls map to a family of classically stable finite energy black holes localized in the IR. We present a conjecture for the qualitative nature of large mass black holes in such backgrounds, and numerically construct these black holes in a particular class of warped geometries.

This argument also holds for other theories with a mass gap and broken chiral symmetry such as QCD with one flavor. For QCD with several flavors a modified clustering property is derived from the low energy chiral Lagrangian. We also obtain sum rules for a fixed external gauge field and show their relation with the bosonized version of the Schwinger model. In the sector of topological charge $\\nu$ the sum rules are consistent with a shift of the Dirac spectrum away from zero by $\\nu/2$ average level spacings. This shift is also required to obtain a nonzero chiral condensate in the massless limit.

More precisely, from Mobius symmetry constraints, the generic three and four point functions of logarithmic quasiprimary fields are calculated in closed form for arbitrary Jordan rank. As an example, c=0 disordered systems with non-degenerate vacua are studied. With the aid of two, three and four point functions, the operator algebra is obtained and associativity of the algebra studied.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.086004","title":"Operator Algebra in Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory","createdAt":"2005-09-27"}

{"abstract":"We discuss the moduli-dependent couplings of the higher derivative F-terms $(\\Tr W^2)^{h-1}$, where $W$ is the gauge N=1 chiral superfield. They are determined by the genus zero topological partition function $F^{(0,h)}$, on a world-sheet with $h$ boundaries. By string duality, these terms are also related to heterotic topological amplitudes studied in the past, with the topological twist applied only in the left-moving supersymmetric sector of the internal $N=(2,0)$ superconformal field theory. The holomorphic anomaly of these couplings relates them to terms of the form $\\Pi^n({\\rm Tr}W^2)^{h-2}$, where $\\Pi$'s represent chiral projections of non-holomorphic functions of chiral superfields. An important property of these couplings is that they violate R-symmetry for $h\\ge 3$. As a result, once supersymmetry is broken by D-term expectation values, $(\\Tr W^2)^2$ generates gaugino masses that can be hierarchically smaller than the scalar masses, behaving as $m_{1/2}\\sim m_0^4$ in string units. Similarly, $\\Pi{\\rm Tr}W^2$ generates Dirac masses for non-chiral brane fermions, of the same order of magnitude.

There is also a vector zero mode with similar localization properties, which is decoupled from conserved sources at tree level. Interestingly, there are no scalar modes, and the model is ghost-free at the linearized level. When the tensor zero mode is localized near the IR brane, the dual interpretation is a composite graviton describing an emergent (induced) theory of gravity at the IR scale.

In the plane orthogonal to their direction they correspond to a nontrivial deformation of the embedded Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortices by the current flowing through them. The new solutions bifurcate with the ANO vortices in the limit of vanishing current. They can be either static or stationary. In the stationary case the relative phase of the two scalars rotates at a constant velocity, giving rise to an electric field and angular momentum, while the energy remains finite. The current has a strong localizing effect on the magnetic field, thus evading the known spreading instability of the ANO-semilocal vortex solutions.

{"abstract":"In this paper we study the systematics of the affine extension of supergravity duality algebras when we step down from D=4 to D=2. For all D=4 supergravities (with N >= 3) there is a universal field theoretical mechanism promoting the extension, which relies on the coexistence of two non locally related lagrangian descriptions. This provides a Chevalley-Serre presentation of the affine Kac Moody algebra which follows a universal pattern for all supergravities and is an extension of the mechanism considered by Nicolai for pure N=1 supergravity. There are new distinctive features in extended theories related to the presence of vector fields and to their symplectic description. The novelty is that in supergravity the so named Matzner-Missner description is structurally different from the Ehlers one with gauge 0--forms subject to SO(2n,2n) electric--magnetic duality rotations representing in D=2 the Sp(2n,R) rotations of D=4. The role played by the symplectic bundle of vectors is emphasized in view of implementing the affine extension also in N=2 supergravity, where the scalar manifold is not necessarily a homogeneous manifold U/H. We show that the mechanism of the affine extension commutes with the Tits Satake projection of the duality algebras. This is very important for the issue of cosmic billiards. We also comment on the general field theoretical mechanism of the further hyperbolic extension obtained in D=1.

{"abstract":"We investigate the confining phase transition as function of temperature for theories with dynamical fermions in the two index symmetric and antisymmetric representation of the gauge group. By studying the properties of the center of the gauge group we predict for an even number of colors a confining phase transition, if second order, to be in the universality class of Ising in three dimensions. This is due to the fact that the center group symmetry does not break completely for an even number of colors. For an odd number of colors the center group symmetry breaks completely. This pattern remains unaltered at large number of colors. We claim that the confining/deconfining phase transition in these theories at large N is not mapped in the one of super Yang-Mills. We extend the Polyakov loop effective theory to describe the confining phase transition of the theories studied here for a generic number of colors. Our results are not modified when adding matter in the same higher dimensional representation of the gauge group. We comment on the interplay between confinement and chiral symmetry in these theories and suggest that they are ideal laboratories to shed light on this issue also for ordinary QCD.

In the case of non-minimal coupling the effective lagrangian contains an axial-vector interaction leading to parity violation. Alternatively, in the case of minimal coupling there is no parity violation and the effective lagrangian contains only the usual axial-axial interaction. In this situation the real values of the Immirzi parameter are not at all constrained.

{"abstract":"The derivation of smooth cosmic billiard solutions through the compensator method is extended to non maximal supergravities. A new key feature is the non-maximal split nature of the scalar coset manifold. To deal with this, one needs the theory of Tits Satake projections leading to maximal split projected algebras. Interesting exact solutions that display several smooth bounces can thus be derived. From the analysis of the Tits Satake projection emerges a regular scheme for all non maximal supergravities and a challenging so far unobserved structure, that of the paint group G-paint. This latter is preserved through dimensional reduction and provides a powerful tool to codify solutions. It appears that the dynamical walls on which the cosmic ball bounces come actually in painted copies rotated into each other by G-paint. The effective cosmic dynamics is that dictated by the maximal split Tits Satake manifold plus paint. We work out in details the example provided by N=6,D=4 supergravity, whose scalar manifold is the special Kahlerian SO*(12)}/SU(6)xU(1). In D=3 it maps to the quaternionic E_7(-5)/ SO(12) x SO(3).

Cosmological data constrains scenarios by putting stringent limits on the fraction of reheating energy deposited in gravitons and nonstandard sector massive relics. We estimate the energy deposited into various light degrees of freedom in the open and closed string sectors, the timing of reheating, and the reheating temperature. Production of gravitons is significantly suppressed in warped inflation.

{"abstract":"We point out an elementary thermodynamics fact that whenever the specific heat of a system is negative, the speed of sound in such a media is imaginary. The latter observation presents a proof of Gubser-Mitra conjecture on the relation between dynamical and thermodynamic instabilities for gravitational backgrounds with a translationary invariant horizon, provided such geometries can be interpreted as holographic duals to finite temperature gauge theories. It further identifies a tachyonic mode of the Gubser-Mitra instability (the lowest quasinormal mode of the corresponding horizon geometry) as a holographic dual to a sound wave in a dual gauge theory. As a specific example, we study sound wave propagation in Little String Theory (LST) compactified on a two-sphere. We find that at high energies (for temperatures close to the LST Hagedorn temperature) the speed of sound is purely imaginary. This implies that the lowest quasinormal mode of the finite temperature Maldacena-Nunez background is tachyonic.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.10.014","title":"A holographic perspective on Gubser-Mitra conjecture","createdAt":"2005-10-17"}

{"abstract":"We study the cosmological evolution of isotropic matter on an infinitely thin conical codimension-two brane-world. Our analysis is based on the boundary dynamics of a six-dimensional model in the presence of an induced gravity term on the brane and a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. With the assumption that the bulk contains only a cosmological constant Lambda_B, we find that the isotropic evolution of the brane-universe imposes a tuned relation between the energy density and the brane equation of state. The evolution of the system has fixed points (attractors), which correspond to a final state of radiation for Lambda_B=0 and to de Sitter state for Lambda_B>0. Furthermore, considering anisotropic matter on the brane, the tuning of the parameters is lifted, and new regions of the parametric space are available for the cosmological evolution of the brane-universe. The analysis of the dynamics of the system shows that, the isotropic fixed points remain attractors of the system, and for values of Lambda_B which give acceptable cosmological evolution of the equation of state, the line of isotropic tuning is a very weak attractor. The initial conditions, in this case, need to be fine tuned to have an evolution with acceptably small anisotropy.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/09/012","title":"Cosmological Evolution of a Purely Conical Codimension-2 Brane World","createdAt":"2005-09-05"}

The standard Skyrme parameters, which are used almost exclusively, fix the pion mass to its experimental value and fit the two remaining Skyrme parameters by approximating the spinning Skyrmion as a rigid body. In this paper we remove the rigid body approximation and perform numerical calculations which allow the spinning Skyrmion to deform and break spherical symmetry. The results show that if the pion mass is set to its experimental value then the nucleon and delta masses can not be reproduced for any values of the Skyrme parameters; the commonly used Skyrme parameters are simply an artifact of the rigid body approximation. However, if the pion mass is taken to be substantially larger than its experimental value then the nucleon and delta masses can be reproduced.

{"abstract":"There is a common description of different intrinsic geometric flows in two dimensions using Toda field equations associated to continual Lie algebras that incorporate the deformation variable t into their system. The Ricci flow admits zero curvature formulation in terms of an infinite dimensional algebra with Cartan operator d/dt. Likewise, the Calabi flow arises as Toda field equation associated to a supercontinual algebra with odd Cartan operator d/d \\theta - \\theta d/dt. Thus, taking the square root of the Cartan operator allows to connect the two distinct classes of geometric deformations of second and fourth order, respectively. The algebra is also used to construct formal solutions of the Calabi flow in terms of free fields by Backlund transformations, as for the Ricci flow. Some applications of the present framework to the general class of Robinson-Trautman metrics that describe spherical gravitational radiation in vacuum in four space-time dimensions are also discussed. Further iteration of the algorithm allows to construct an infinite hierarchy of higher order geometric flows, which are integrable in two dimensions and they admit immediate generalization to Kahler manifolds in all dimensions.

Here we show that one of the central presumptions of the debate is incorrect. Ensuring that information not escape during the semi-classical evaporation process does not require that all the information remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation. Using recent results in quantum information theory, we find that the amount of information that must remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation can be very small, even though the amount already radiated away is negligible. Quantum effects mean that information need not be additive: a small number of quanta can lock a large amount of information, making it inaccessible. When this small number of locking quanta are finally emitted, the full information (and unitarity) is restored.

{"abstract":"Recent results on BPS solitons in the Higgs phase of supersymmetric (SUSY) gauge theories with eight supercharges are reviewed. For U(N_C) gauge theories with the N_F(>N_C) hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, the total moduli space of walls are found to be the complex Grassmann manifold SU(N_F)/[SU(N_C)xSU(N_F-N_C)xU(1)]. The monopole in the Higgs phase has to accompany vortices, and preserves a 1/4 of SUSY. We find that walls are also allowed to coexist with them. We obtain all the solutions of such 1/4 BPS composite solitons in the strong coupling limit. Instantons in the Higgs phase is also obtained as 1/4 BPS states. As another instructive example, we take U(1)xU(1) gauge theories with four hypermultiplets. We find that the moduli space is the union of several special Lagrangian submanifolds of the Higgs branch vacua of the corresponding massless theory. We also observe transmutation of walls and repulsion and attraction of BPS walls.

For AdS_5 Schwarzschild black holes, our arguments are made using the field theory dual to string theory in such spacetimes. Our results follow from applying information theoretic notions to field theory operators capable of describing very heavy states in gravity. For half-BPS states of the theory which are incipient black holes, our account is exact: typical microstates are described in gravity by a spacetime ``foam'', the precise details of which are almost invisible to almost all probes. We show that universal low-energy effective description of a foam of given global charges is via certain singular spacetime geometries. When one of the specified charges is the number of D-branes, the effective singular geometry is the half-BPS ``superstar''.

{"abstract":"We investigate the problem of fine tuning of the potential in the KKLMMT warped flux compactification scenario for brane-antibrane inflation in Type IIB string theory. We argue for the importance of an additional parameter psi_0 (approximated as zero by KKLMMT), namely the position of the antibrane, relative to the equilibrium position of the brane in the absence of the antibrane. We show that for a range of values of a particular combination of the Kahler modulus, warp factor, and psi_0, the inflaton potential can be sufficiently flat. We point out a novel mechanism for dynamically achieving flatness within this part of parameter space: the presence of multiple mobile branes can lead to a potential which initially has a metastable local minimum, but gradually becomes flat as some of the branes tunnel out. Eventually the local minimum disappears and the remaining branes slowly roll together, with assisted inflation further enhancing the effective flatness of the potential. With the addition of Kahler and superpotential corrections, this mechanism can completely remove the fine tuning problem of brane inflation, within large regions of parameter space. The model can be falsified if future cosmic microwave background observations confirm the hint of a large running spectral index.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.126004","title":"Multibrane Inflation and Dynamical Flattening of the Inflaton Potential","createdAt":"2006-01-08"}

The general case of different Robin coefficients on separate branes is considered. The application of the generalized Abel-Plana formula for the series over zeros of combinations of cylinder functions allows us to extract manifestly the part due to the bulk without boundaries. Unlike to the purely AdS bulk, the vacuum expectation value of the field square induced by a single brane, in addition to the distance from the brane, depends also on the position of the brane in the bulk.

The unstable negative part is eliminated by a constraint on physical states, which is invariant under the Hamiltonian flow. In this way, choosing suitable phase space coordinates, the classical Liouville equation becomes a functional Schroedinger equation of a genuine quantum field theory.

{"abstract":"We investigate a simple class of type II string compactifications which incorporate nongeometric \"fluxes\" in addition to \"geometric flux\" and the usual H-field and R-R fluxes. These compactifications are nongeometric analogues of the twisted torus. We develop T-duality rules for NS-NS geometric and nongeometric fluxes, which we use to construct a superpotential for the dimensionally reduced four-dimensional theory. The resulting structure is invariant under T-duality, so that the distribution of vacua in the IIA and IIB theories is identical when nongeometric fluxes are included. This gives a concrete framework in which to investigate the possibility that generic string compactifications may be nongeometric in any duality frame. The framework developed in this paper also provides some concrete hints for how mirror symmetry can be generalized to compactifications with arbitrary H-flux, whose mirrors are generically nongeometric.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/085","title":"Nongeometric Flux Compactifications","createdAt":"2006-07-03"}

In this configuration, the lowest scale is just above the Hubble scale, which is compatible with effective field theory but still leads to potentially observable CMB corrections.

By fixing the uniform gauge we show that physical excitations in this sector are described by two complex fermionic degrees of freedom and we obtain the corresponding Lagrangian. Remarkably, this Lagrangian can be cast in a two-dimensional Lorentz-invariant form. The kinetic part of the Lagrangian induces a non-trivial Poisson structure while the Hamiltonian is just the one of the massive Dirac fermion. We find a change of variables which brings the Poisson structure to the canonical form but makes the Hamiltonian nontrivial. The Hamiltonian is derived as an exact function of two parameters: the total S^5 angular momentum J and string tension \\lambda; it is a polynomial in 1/J and in \\sqrt{\\lambda'} where \\lambda'=\\frac{\\lambda}{J^2} is the effective BMN coupling. We identify the string states dual to the gauge theory operators from the closed su(1|1) sector of N=4 SYM and show that the corresponding near-plane wave energy shift computed from our Hamiltonian perfectly agrees with that recently found in the literature.

The two metrics are not always diagonalizable in the same coordinate system, and the light-cone structure of both metrics can be quite different. In spite of this, we find that causality is preserved, in the sense that closed time-like curves cannot be pieced together from geodesics of both metrics.

Concretely, we consider the known string loop corrections and tree-level alpha' corrections.

We argue that when combined, these corrections provide enough flexibility to stabilize the volume of the internal space without non-perturbative effects, although we are not able to present a completely explicit example within the limited set of currently available models.

{"abstract":"Combination of both quantum field theory (QFT) and string theory in curved backgrounds in a consistent framework, the string analogue model, allows us to provide a full picture of the Kerr-Newman black hole and its evaporation going beyond the current picture. We compute the quantum emission cross section of strings by a Kerr-Newmann black hole (KNbh). It shows the black hole emission at the Hawking temperature T_{sem} in the early evaporation and the new string emission featuring a Hagedorn transition into a string state of temperature T_ s at the last stages. New bounds on the angular momentum J and charge Q emerge in the quantum string regime. The last state of evaporation of a semiclassical KNbh is a string state of temperature T_s, mass M_s, J = 0 = Q, decaying as a quantum string into all kinds of particles.(There is naturally, no loss of information, (no paradox at all)). We compute the microscopic string entropy S_s(m, j) of mass m and spin mode j.

{"abstract":"The spectral analysis of the electromagnetic field on the background of a infinitely thin flat plasma layer is carried out. This model is loosely imitating a single base plane from graphite and it is of interest for theoretical studies of fullerenes. The model is naturally split into the TE-sector and TM-sector. Both the sectors have positive continuous spectra, but the TM-modes have in addition a bound state, namely, the surface plasmon. This analysis relies on the consideration of the scattering problem in the TE- and TM-sectors. The spectral zeta function and integrated heat kernel are constructed for different branches of the spectrum in an explicit form. As a preliminary, the rigorous procedure of integration over the continuous spectra is formulated by introducing the spectral densityin terms of the scattering phase shifts. The asymptotic expansion of the integrated heat kernel at small values of the evolution parameter is derived. By making use of the technique of integral equations, developed earlier by the same authors, the local heat kernel (Green's function or fundamental solution) is constructed also. As a by-product, a new method is demonstrated for deriving the fundamental solution to the heat conduction equation (or to the Schr\\\"odinger equation) on an infinite line with the $\\delta $-like source. In particular, for the heat conduction equation on an infinite line with the $\\delta$-source a nontrivial counterpart is found, namely, a spectral problem with point interaction, that possesses the same integrated heat kernel while the local heat kernels (fundamental solutions) in these spectral problems are different.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/0305-4470/38/50/011","title":"Spectral analysis of a flat plasma sheet model","createdAt":"2005-12-25"}

The inflationary era in the very early universe ended with such a transition to our current phase which is described by a broken supersymmetry and a small, positive vacuum energy. However, it is likely that an exactly supersymmetric (susy) phase of zero vacuum energy as in the original superstring theory also exists and that, at some time in the future, there will be a transition to this susy world.

In the simplest case two possible equilibrium points exist, one at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature for an asymptotic de Sitter universe embedded in an Anti-de Sitter bulk and another with a non-zero density on the brane universe. We calculate various limiting cases of Wightman functions in N-dimensional AdS spacetime and show explicitly that the Unruh effect only occurs for accelerations above the mass scale of the spacetime.

We use a path integral method to define the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state in such spacetimes and discuss explicitly its entangled nature and its relation to the geometry. If string theory on such spacetimes has a field theory dual, then, in the low-energy, weak coupling limit, the field theory state that is dual to the Hartle-Hawking state is a thermofield double state.

{"abstract":"In the interesting conjecture, Z_{BH} = |Z_{top}|^2, proposed by Ooguri, Strominger and Vafa (OSV), the black hole ensemble is a mixed ensemble and the resulting degeneracy of states, as obtained from the ensemble inverse-Laplace integration, suffers from prefactors which do not respect the electric-magnetic duality. One idea to overcome this deficiency, as claimed recently, is imposing nontrivial measures for the ensemble sum. We address this problem and upon a redefinition of the OSV ensemble whose variables are as numerous as the electric potentials, show that for restoring the symmetry no non-Euclidean measure is needful. In detail, we rewrite the OSV free energy as a function of new variables which are combinations of the electric-potentials and the black hole charges. Subsequently the Legendre transformation which bridges between the entropy and the black hole free energy in terms of these variables, points to a generalized ensemble. In this context, we will consider all the cases of relevance: small and large black holes, with or without D_6-brane charge. For the case of vanishing D_6-brane charge, the new ensemble is pure canonical and the electric-magnetic duality is restored exactly, leading to proper results for the black hole degeneracy of states. For more general cases, the construction still works well as far as the violation of the duality by the corresponding OSV result is restricted to a prefactor. In a concrete example we shall show that for black holes with non-vanishing D_6-brane charge, there are cases where the duality violation goes beyond this restriction, thus imposing non-trivial measures is incapable of restoring the duality. This observation signals for a deeper modification in the OSV proposal.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1063/1.2393149","title":"Minimal redefinition of the OSV ensemble","createdAt":"2005-09-03"}

Moreover, a prescription is given for the coupling of p-adic strings to a magnetic field, thus allowing to study p-adic solitons using non-commutative field-theory techniques. The link with topological D-branes is provided by the non-commutative description of D-branes in the B-model. The fibre bundles supported by the D-branes are still holomorphic in this description. Establishing this property involves the realization of D-branes as boundary conditions, within the framework of generalized complex geometry. This geometric framework is then used to describe mirror symmetry with D-branes on a Calabi--Yau manifold admitting a $T^3$-fibration. Two pure spinors, involved in the stability equations for topological D-branes, and modified by gauge fields, are exchanged, thus unifying Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian D-branes of the A-model as mirrors of stable D-branes of the B-model.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0508242","title":"D-branes, actions effectives et sym\\'etrie miroir","createdAt":"2005-08-31"}

The derivation was based on Ward identities derived from the decoupling of zero-norm states and was purely algebraic.

In this paper, using the decoupling of spurious states, we reduce this assumption to a much weaker one which can be easily verified by simple power counting in most cases. For the special cases which are less obvious, we verify the new assumption for an example by saddle-point approximation.

Our vastly increased understanding of the physical world acquired during the 20th century has made this a certainty. The laws of quantum theory tell us that looking at spacetime at ever smaller scales requires ever larger energies, and, according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, this will alter spacetime itself: it will acquire structure in the form of \"curvature\".

We present arguments that in conformal HD theories the ghosts (which are inherent for HD theories) might be not so malignant. In particular, we present a nontrivial QM HD model where ghosts are absent and the spectrum has a well defined ground state. The requirement of superconformal invariance restricts the dimension of the bulk to be D < 7. We suggest that the TOE lives in six dimensions and enjoys the maximum N = (2,0) superconformal symmetry. Unfortunately, no renormalizable field theory with this symmetry is presently known. We construct and discuss an N = (1,0) 6D supersymmetric gauge theory with four derivatives in the action. This theory involves a dimensionless coupling constant and is renormalizable. At the tree level, the theory enjoys conformal symmetry, but the latter is broken by quantum anomaly.

{"abstract":"It has recently been suggested, by Firouzjahi, Sarangi, and Tye, that string-motivated modifications of the Hartle-Hawking wave function predict that our Universe came into existence from \"nothing\" with a de Sitter-like spacetime geometry and a spacetime curvature similar to that of \"low-scale\" models of Inflation. This means, however, that the Universe was quite large at birth. It would be preferable for the initial scale to be close to the string scale, or perhaps the Planck scale. The problem with this, however, is to explain how any initial homogeneity is preserved during the pre-inflationary era, so that Inflation can indeed begin. Here we modify a suggestion due to Linde and assume that the Universe was born with the topology of a torus; however, we propose that the size of the torus is to be predicted by the FST wave function. The latter does predict an initial size for the torus at about the string scale, and it also predicts a pre-inflationary spacetime geometry such that chaotic mixing preserves any initial homogeneity until Inflation can begin at a relatively low scale.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics"],"doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.10.008","title":"The Most Probable Size of the Universe","createdAt":"2005-10-11"}

{"abstract":"We examine the problem of counting bound states of BPS black holes on local Calabi-Yau threefolds which are fibrations over a Riemann surface by computing the partition function of q-deformed Yang-Mills theory on the Riemann surface. We study in detail the genus zero case and obtain, at finite $N$, the instanton expansion of the gauge theory. It can be written exactly as the partition function for U(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory on a Lens space, summed over all non-trivial vacua, plus a tower of non-perturbative instanton contributions. The correspondence between two and three dimensional gauge theories is elucidated by an explicit mapping between two-dimensional Yang-Mills instantons and flat connections on the Lens space. In the large $N$ limit we find a peculiar phase structure in the model. At weak string coupling the theory reduces exactly to the trivial flat connection sector with instanton contributions exponentially suppressed, and the topological string partition function on the resolved conifold is reproduced in this regime. At a certain critical point all non-trivial vacua contribute, instantons are enhanced and the theory appears to undergo a phase transition into a strong coupling regime. We rederive these results by performing a saddle-point approximation to the exact partition function. We obtain a q-deformed version of the Douglas-Kazakov equation for two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on the sphere, whose one-cut solution below the transition point reproduces the resolved conifold geometry. Above the critical point we propose a two-cut solution that should reproduce the chiral-antichiral dynamics found for black holes on the Calabi-Yau threefold and the Gross-Taylor string in the undeformed limit.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/01/035","title":"Topological strings and large N phase transitions I: Nonchiral expansion of q-deformed Yang-Mills theory","createdAt":"2005-11-26"}

It does not contain higher derivatives of the tensor gauge fields, and all interactions take place through three- and four-particle exchanges with dimensionless coupling constant. In this extension of the Yang-Mills theory the vector gauge boson becomes a member of a bigger family of tensor gauge bosons. We shall present a second invariant Lagrangian which can be constructed in terms of the above field strength tensors. The total Lagrangian is a sum of the two Lagrangians and exhibits enhanced local gauge invariance with double number of gauge parameters.

{"abstract":"One way to relate semiclassical string states and dual gauge theory states is to show the equivalence between their low-energy effective 2d actions. The gauge theory effective action, which is represented by an effective Landau-Lifshitz (LL) model, was previously found to match with the string theory world-sheet action up to the first two orders in the effective parameter $\\tilde{\\lambda} ={\\lambda / J^2}$, where $\\lambda$ is the `t Hooft coupling and $J$ is the total $R$-charge. Here we address the question if quantizing the effective LL action reproduces the subleading 1/J corrections to the spin chain energies as well as the quantum corrections to the string energies. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case provided one chooses an appropriate regularization of the effective LL theory. Expanding near the BPS vacuum, we show that the quantum LL action gives the same 1/J corrections to energies of BMN states as found previously on the gauge theory and string theory sides. We also compute the subleading $1/J^2$ corrections and show that these too match with corrections computed from the Bethe ansatz. We also compare the results from the LL action with a more direct computation from the spin chain. We repeat the same computation for the $\\beta$-deformed LL action and find that the quantum LL result is again equal to the 1/J correction computed from the $\\beta$-deformed Bethe ansatz equations. We also quantize the LL action near the rotating circular and folded string solutions, generalizing the known gauge/string results for 1/J corrections to the classical energies. We emphasize the simplicity of this effective field theory approach as compared to the full quantum string computations.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.12.003","title":"1/J corrections to semiclassical AdS/CFT states from quantum Landau-Lifshitz model","createdAt":"2005-09-18"}

The inflaton in our proposed framework is a scalar field with a quadratic kinetic energy term, but with the `wrong sign'. We take the perspective that this is due to some temporary instability in our system at high energies, and provide physical examples of situations where a modulus field might temprorarily exhibit such behaviour. The deflation of extra dimensions is a neccesary feature of our framework.

{"abstract":"One of the leading candidates for quantum gravity, viz. string theory, has the following features incorporated in it. (i) The full spacetime is higher dimensional, with (possibly) compact extra-dimensions; (ii) There is a natural minimal length below which the concept of continuum spacetime needs to be modified by some deeper concept. On the other hand, the existence of a minimal length (or zero-point length) in four-dimensional spacetime, with obvious implications as UV regulator, has been often conjectured as a natural aftermath of any correct quantum theory of gravity. We show that one can incorporate the apparently unrelated pieces of information - zero-point length, extra-dimensions, string T-duality - in a consistent framework. This is done in terms of a modified Kaluza-Klein theory that interpolates between (high-energy) string theory and (low-energy) quantum field theory. In this model, the zero-point length in four dimensions is a ``virtual memory'' of the length scale of compact extra-dimensions. Such a scale turns out to be determined by T-duality inherited from the underlying fundamental string theory. From a low energy perspective short distance infinities are cut off by a minimal length which is proportional to the square root of the string slope, i.e. \\sqrt{\\alpha^\\prime}.

{"abstract":"We analyze the phase structure and the renormalization group (RG) flow of the generalized sine-Gordon models with nonvanishing mass terms, using the Wegner-Houghton RG method in the local potential approximation. Particular emphasis is laid upon the layered sine-Gordon (LSG) model, which is the bosonized version of the multi-flavour Schwinger model and approaches the sum of two ``normal'', massless sine-Gordon (SG) models in the limit of a vanishing interlayer coupling J. Another model of interest is the massive sine-Gordon (MSG) model. The leading-order approximation to the UV (ultra-violet) RG flow predicts two phases for the LSG as well as for the MSG, just as it would be expected for the SG model, where the two phases are known to be separated by the Coleman fixed point. The presence of finite mass terms (for the LSG and the MSG) leads to corrections to the UV RG flow, which are naturally identified as the ``mass corrections''. The leading-order mass corrections are shown to have the following consequences: (i) for the MSG model, only one phase persists, and (ii) for the LSG model, the transition temperature is modified. Within the mass-corrected UV scaling laws, the limit of J -> 0 is thus nonuniform with respect to the phase structure of the model. The modified phase structure of general massive sine-Gordon models is connected with the breaking of symmetries in the internal space spanned by the field variables.

{"abstract":"A factorization of spacetime of the form M^3xM^3xM^3 is considered in this paper as the closed string background in type IIA. The idea behind this construction is that each M^3 might give rise to one large spatial dimension of 4-dimensional spacetime in the closed string sector. In the open string sector, intersecting D6-branes can be constructed for the simple choice of an orientifolded M^3=T^3 in a similar way as on the prominent T^6=T^2xT^2xT^2 using exact CFT. The D6-branes then are allowed to span general 2-cycles on each T^3. The intersection 1-cycles between two stacks of branes on one T^3 can be understood as one spatial dimension of the effective 4-dimensional 'spacetime' for the massless chiral fermions charged under these two stacks. Additionally to the known solutions to the R-R tadpole equations conserving (3+1)-dimensional Poincare invariance, this allows for solutions with globally just (2+1)- or (1+1)-Poincare invariance. For non-supersymmetric solutions, a string tree-level and one-loop potential for the scalar moduli (including the spacetime radii) is generated in the NS-NS sector. This potential here is interpreted dynamically for radii and dilaton in order to describe the global evolution of the universe. In the late time picture, (3+1)-dimensional global Poincare invariance can be restored well within experimental bounds. This approach links particle properties (the massless chiral fermion spectrum) directly to the global evolution of the universe by the scalar potential, both depending on the same topological wrapping numbers. In the future, this might lead to much better falsifiable phenomenological models.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.73.046003","title":"A new picture for 4-dimensional 'spacetime' from intersecting D-branes on the T^9","createdAt":"2005-10-27"}

{"abstract":"We study the two-loop dilatation operator in the noncompact SL(2) sector of QCD and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with N=1,2,4 supercharges. The analysis is performed for Wilson operators built from three quark/gaugino fields of the same helicity belonging to the fundamental/adjoint representation of the SU(3)/SU(N_c) gauge group and involving an arbitrary number of covariant derivatives projected onto the light-cone. To one-loop order, the dilatation operator inherits the conformal symmetry of the classical theory and is given in the multi-color limit by a local Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg magnet with the spin operators being generators of the collinear subgroup of full (super)conformal group. Starting from two loops, the dilatation operator depends on the representation of the gauge group and, in addition, receives corrections stemming from the violation of the conformal symmetry. We compute its eigenspectrum and demonstrate that to two-loop order integrability survives the conformal symmetry breaking in the aforementioned gauge theories, but it is violated in QCD by the contribution of nonplanar diagrams. In SYM theories with extended supersymmetry, the N-dependence of the two-loop dilatation operator can be factorized (modulo an additive normalization constant) into a multiplicative c-number. This property makes the eigenspectrum of the two-loop dilatation operator alike in all gauge theories including the maximally supersymmetric theory.

The gauge theory in question is found on N D3-branes placed at the tip of the cone R^6/Gamma.

In this paper we observe a precise correspondence between the instabilities caused by the flow of these double-trace couplings and the presence of tachyons in the twisted sectors of type IIB theory on orbifolds R^{3,1}x R^6/Gamma. For each twisted sectors that does not contain tachyons, we show that the corresponding double-trace coupling flows to a fixed point and does not cause an instability. However, whenever a twisted sector is tachyonic, we find that the corresponding one-loop beta function does not have a real zero, hence an instability is likely to exist in the gauge theory.

We discuss a scheme where this constant is replaced by a dynamical quantity which we argue to be a `continuous Chern--Simons term'. In such a scheme, the gaugino condensate generates the hierarchically small scale of supersymmetry breakdown rather than adjusting its size to a constant. A crucial ingredient is the appearance of the hierarchically small quantity exp(-<X>) which corresponds to the scale of gaugino condensation. Under rather general circumstances, this leads to a scenario of moduli stabilization, which is endowed with a hierarchy between the mass of the lightest modulus, the gravitino mass and the scale of the soft terms, m_modulus ~ <X> m_3/2 ~ <X>^2 m_soft. The `little hierarchy' <X> is given by the logarithm of the ratio of the Planck scale and the gravitino mass, <X> ~ log(M_Pl/m_3/2) ~ 4pi^2. This exhibits a new mediation scheme of supersymmetry breakdown, called mirage mediation.

{"abstract":"String theory in Euclidean flat space with a spacelike linear dilaton contains a D1-brane which looks like a semi-infinite hairpin. In addition to its curved shape, this ``hairpin brane'' has a condensate of the open string tachyon stretched between its two sides. The tachyon smears the brane and shifts the location of its tip. The Minkowski continuation of the hairpin brane describes a D0-brane freely falling in a linear dilaton background. Effects that in Euclidean space are attributed to the tachyon condensate, give rise in the Minkowski case to a stringy smearing of the trajectory of the D-brane by an amount that grows as its acceleration increases. When the Unruh temperature of the brane reaches the Hagedorn temperature of perturbative string theory in the throat, the rolling D-brane state becomes non-normalizable. We propose that black holes in string theory exhibit similar properties. The Euclidean black hole solution has a condensate of a tachyon winding around Euclidean time. The Minkowski manifestation of this condensate is a smearing of the geometry in a layer around the horizon. As the Hawking temperature, T_{bh}, increases, the width of this layer grows. When T_{bh} reaches the Hagedorn temperature, the size of this ``smeared horizon'' diverges, and the black hole becomes non-normalizable. This provides a new point of view on the string/black hole transition.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0509170","title":"Accelerating Branes and the String/Black Hole Transition","createdAt":"2005-09-21"}

{"abstract":"Braneworld cosmology supported by a bulk scalar field with an exponential potential is developed. A general class of separable backgrounds for both single and two-brane systems is derived, where the bulk metric components are given by products of world-volume and bulk coordinates and the world-volumes represent any anisotropic and inhomogeneous solution to an effective four-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory of gravity. We deduce a cosmic no hair theorem for all ever expanding, spatially homogeneous Bianchi world-volumes and find that the spatially flat and isotropic inflationary scaling solution represents a late-time attractor when the bulk potential is sufficiently flat. The dependence of this result on the separable nature of the bulk metric is investigated by applying the techniques of Hamilton-Jacobi theory to five-dimensional Einstein gravity. We employ the spatial gradient expansion method to determine the asymptotic form of the bulk metric up to third-order in spatial gradients. It is found that the condition for the separable form of the metric to represent the attractor of the system is precisely the same as that for the four-dimensional world-volume to isotropize. We also derive the fourth-order contribution to the Hamilton-Jacobi generating functional. Finally, we conclude by placing our results within the context of the holographic approach to braneworld cosmology.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics",null],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.103507","title":"Cosmic No Hair for Braneworlds with a Bulk Dilaton Field","createdAt":"2005-09-22"}

{"abstract":"It has been argued that certain reduced actions play a role in AdS/CFT when comparing fast moving strings to long single trace operators in gauge theories. Such actions arise in two ways: as a limit of the string action and as a description of long single trace field theory operators. They are non-relativistic sigma models with the target space usually being a Kahler manifold. They are non-renormalizable and need a cut-off in the wave-length. If the total spin (or charge) contained in a minimal wavelength is large compared to one, the system behaves approximately classically and an expansion in loops is meaningful. In this paper we apply the renormalization group procedure to such actions and find, at one-loop, that the Kahler potential flows in the infrared to a Kahler-Einstein one.Therefore, in this context, the anomalous dimensions of long operators are determined by a fixed point. This suggests that certain features of the large N-limit might be independent of the detailed properties of a gauge theory.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0509178","title":"Renormalization group flow of reduced string actions","createdAt":"2005-09-22"}

{"abstract":"The tetrahedron equation is a three-dimensional generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation. Its solutions define integrable three-dimensional lattice models of statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Their integrability is not related to the size of the lattice, therefore the same solution of the tetrahedron equation defines different integrable models for different finite periodic cubic lattices. Obviously, any such three-dimensional model can be viewed as a two-dimensional integrable model on a square lattice, where the additional third dimension is treated as an internal degree of freedom. Therefore every solution of the tetrahedron equation provides an infinite sequence of integrable 2d models differing by the size of this \"hidden third dimension\". In this paper we construct a new solution of the tetrahedron equation, which provides in this way the two-dimensional solvable models related to finite-dimensional highest weight representations for all quantum affine algebra $U_q(\\hat{sl}(n))$, where the rank $n$ coincides with the size of the hidden dimension. These models are related with an anisotropic deformation of the $sl(n)$-invariant Heisenberg magnets. They were extensively studied for a long time, but the hidden 3d structure was hitherto unknown. Our results lead to a remarkable exact \"rank-size\" duality relation for the nested Bethe Ansatz solution for these models. Note also, that the above solution of the tetrahedron equation arises in the quantization of the \"resonant three-wave scattering\" model, which is a well-known integrable classical system in 2+1 dimensions.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematical Physics","Quantum Algebra","Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"doi":"10.1088/0305-4470/39/13/009","title":"Zamolodchikov's Tetrahedron Equation and Hidden Structure of Quantum Groups","createdAt":"2005-10-10"}
{"abstract":"The effective Friedmann equation describing the evolution of the brane Universe in the cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum model includes a dark (or mirage or Weyl) radiation term. The brane evolution can be interpreted as the motion of the brane in an AdS-Schwarzschild bulk geometry. The energy density of the dark radiation is proportional to the black hole mass. We generalize this result for an AdS bulk space with an arbitrary matter component. We show that the mirage term retains its form, but the black hole mass is replaced by the covariantly defined integrated mass of the bulk matter. As this mass depends explicitly on the scale factor on the brane, the mirage term does not scale as pure radiation. For low energy densities the brane cosmological evolution is that of a four-dimensional Universe with two matter components: the matter localized on the brane and the mirage matter. There is conservation of energy between the two components. This behaviour indicates a duality between the bulk theory and a four-dimensional theory on the brane. The equation of state of the generalized dark radiation is that of a conformal field theory, with an explicit breaking of the conformal invariance through the pressure of the bulk fluid. Accelerated expansion on the brane is possible only if there is negative pressure on the brane or in the bulk, or if the integrated mass of the bulk fluid is negative.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1016/j.physletb.2005.12.015","title":"The Generalized Dark Radiation and Accelerated Expansion in Brane Cosmology","createdAt":"2005-12-05"}

{"abstract":"The structure of the UV divergencies in higher dimensional nonrenormalizable theories is analysed. Based on renormalization operation and renormalization group theory it is shown that even in this case the leading divergencies (asymptotics) are governed by the one-loop diagrams the number of which, however, is infinite. Explicit expression for the one-loop counter term in an arbitrary D-dimensional quantum field theory without derivatives is suggested. This allows one to sum up the leading asymptotics which are independent of the arbitrariness in subtraction of higher order operators. Diagrammatic calculations in a number of scalar models in higher loops are performed to be in agreement with the above statements. These results do not support the idea of the na\\\"ive power-law running of couplings in nonrenormalizable theories and fail (with one exception) to reveal any simple closed formula for the leading terms.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1088/0305-4470/39/25/S17","title":"Renormalization Group Treatment of Nonrenormalizable Interactions","createdAt":"2005-09-28"}

{"abstract":"Chiral antisymmetric tensor fields can have chiral couplings to quarks and leptons. Their kinetic terms do not mix different representations of the Lorentz symmetry and a local mass term is forbidden by symmetry. The chiral couplings to the fermions are asymptotically free, opening interesting perspectives for a possible solution to the gauge hierarchy problem. We argue that the interacting theory for such fields can be consistently quantized, in contrast to the free theory which is plagued by unstable solutions. We suggest that at the scale where the chiral couplings grow large the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken and a mass term for the chiral tensors is generated non-perturbatively.

We show how to construct the equivalent of three family orbifold GUTs in five dimensions from the heterotic string. I focus on one particular model with E(6) gauge symmetry in 5D, the third family and Higgs doublet coming from the 5D bulk and the first two families living on 4D SO(10) branes. Note the E(6) gauge symmetry is broken to Pati-Salam in 4D which subsequently breaks to the Standard Model gauge symmetry via the Higgs mechanism. The model has two flaws, one fatal and one perhaps only unaesthetic. The model has a small set of vector-like exotics with fractional electromagnetic charge. Unfortunately not all of these states obtain mass at the compactification scale. This flaw is fatal. The second problem is R parity violating interactions.

The main differences of our approach with respect to previous works appear on spacetimes with non trivial torsion elements on its second integral cohomology group. We show that in these spacetimes there can be topologically non-trivial configurations of charged fields which do not imply charge quantization. However, the existence of a non-exact electromagnetic field always implies the quantization of charges. Another consequence of the theory for spacetimes with torsion is the fact that it gives rise to two natural quantization units that could be identified with the electric quantization unit (realized inside the quarks) and with the electron charge. In this framework the color charge can have a topological origin, with the number of colors being related to the order of the torsion subgroup. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the quantization of charge may be due to a weak non-exact component of the electromagnetic field extended over cosmological scales.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1088/0305-4470/39/30/013","title":"Weak gauge principle and electric charge quantization","createdAt":"2006-06-28"}

Eventually the minimum disappears and the remaining branes roll slowly because the potential is nearly flat.

Upon lifting to eleven dimensions this determines the coefficient of the D^6R^4 interaction in eleven-dimensional M-theory. These results are obtained by considering the four-graviton two-loop scattering amplitude in eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on a circle and on a two-torus -- extending earlier results concerning lower-derivative interactions. The torus compactification leads to an interesting SL(2,Z)-invariant function of the complex structure of the torus (the IIB string coupling) that satisfies a Laplace equation with a source term on the fundamental domain of moduli space. The structure of this equation is in accord with general supersymmetry considerations and immediately determines tree-level and one-loop contributions to D^6R^4 in perturbative IIB string theory that agree with explicit string calculations, and two-loop and three-loop contributions that have yet to be obtained in string theory. The complete solution of the Laplace equation contains infinite series' of single D-instanton and double D-instanton contributions, in addition to the perturbative terms.

{"abstract":"Spacetimes obtained by dimensional reduction along lattices containing a lightlike direction can admit semigroup extensions of their isometry groups. We show by concrete examples that such a semigroup can exhibit a natural order, which in turn implies the existence of preferred coordinate charts on the underlying space. Specifically, for spacetimes which are products of an external Minkowski space with an internal two-dimensional Lorentzian space, where one of the lightlike directions has a compact size, the preferred charts consist of \"infinite-momentum\" frames on the internal space. This implies that fields viewed from this preferred frame acquire extreme values; in particular, some of the off-diagonal components of the higher-dimensional metric, which may be regarded as gauge potentials for a field theory on the external Minkowski factor, vanish. This raises the possibility of regarding known gauge theories as part of more extended field multiplets which have been reduced in size since they are perceived from within an extreme frame. In the case of an external 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime times a two-dimensional Lorentzian cylinder, the field content as seen in the preferred frame is that of a five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory, where the electrodynamic potentials Am may depend, in addition to the external spacetime coordinates, on a fifth coordinate along a lightlike direction. The fact that the metric along this direction is zero obstructs the generation of field equations from the Ricci tensor of the overall metric.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null,"Mathematical Physics"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0510028","title":"Compactification along Lightlike Lattices","createdAt":"2005-10-04"}

{"abstract":"I argue that string theory compactified on a Riemann surface crosses over at small volume to a higher dimensional background of supercritical string theory. Several concrete measures of the count of degrees of freedom of the theory yield the consistent result that at finite volume, the effective dimensionality is increased by an amount of order $2h/V$ for a surface of genus $h$ and volume $V$ in string units. This arises in part from an exponentially growing density of states of winding modes supported by the fundamental group, and passes an interesting test of modular invariance. Further evidence for a plethora of examples with the spacelike singularity replaced by a higher dimensional phase arises from the fact that the sigma model on a Riemann surface can be naturally completed by many gauged linear sigma models, whose RG flows approximate time evolution in the full string backgrounds arising from this in the limit of large dimensionality. In recent examples of spacelike singularity resolution by tachyon condensation, the singularity is ultimately replaced by a phase with all modes becoming heavy and decoupling. In the present case, the opposite behavior ensues: more light degrees of freedom arise in the small radius regime.

Inflating degrees of freedom are traced over and do not appear explicitly in the boundary description. They nevertheless leave a distinct imprint on the mixed state. In the supergravity approximation, analytic continuation connects AdS/CFT correlators to dS/CFT correlators. This provides a framework for extracting further information as well. Our work also shows that no scattering process can create an inflating region, even by quantum tunneling, since a pure state can never evolve into a mixed state under unitary evolution.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/03/007","title":"Inflation in AdS/CFT","createdAt":"2006-03-02"}

By choosing a particular solution of the equations of motion we obtain a functional description of either field in terms of the other one. In this way we obtain non-trivial configurations 'C=C(A)' or 'A=A(C)' such that, in the effective broken theories containing only one gauge field, the usual field discontinuities in the presence of both electric and magnetic monopoles are absent. These fields regularity is achieved through corrections, inherited from the unbroken theory, to the standard definitions of electromagnetic fields and four-currents. Based in these results we also demonstrate non-triviality of the unbroken theory, in the presence of both electric and magnetic four-currents, there are no trivial solutions compatible with the equations of motion for both fields. Moreover we demonstrate that, although in complete agreement with the Maxwell equations, extended 'Ue(1)xUg(1)' electromagnetism is not equivalent to the standard variational 'U(1)' Maxwell electromagnetism. We further show that the unbroken theory is invariant under a combination of Hodge dualities that has as self-dual point the field configuration corresponding to the zero-field equation. In addition this condition has the particularity of being the only configuration compatible with the mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking proposed here that is also gauge invariant in the unbroken theory.

In this paper we continue this study for the conjectured Bethe ansatz for the long range spin chain representing perturbative planar N=4 Super Yang-Mills in the SU(2) sector, and the ``quantum string\" Bethe ansatz for its string dual. The comparison is carried out for corrections to BMN energies up to 3rd order in the effective expansion parameter $\\tl=\\lambda/J^2$. After determining the ``gauge-theory'' LL action to order $\\tl^3$, which is accomplished indirectly by fixing the coefficients in the LL action so that the energies of circular strings match with the energies found using the Bethe ansatz, we find perfect agreement. We interpret this as further support for an underlying integrability of the system. We then consider the ``string-theory'' LL action which is a limit of the classical string action representing fast string motion on an S^3 subspace of S^5 and compare the resulting $\\tl^3/J^2$ corrections to the prediction of the ``string'' Bethe ansatz. As in the gauge case, we find precise matching. This indicates that the LL Hamiltonian supplemented with a normal ordering prescription and zeta-function regularization reproduces the full superstring result for the $1/J^2$ corrections, and also signifies that the string Bethe ansatz does describe the quantum BMN string spectrum to order $1/J^2$.

Compactifying these solutions into five dimensions, we show that these solutions include the BMPV black hole and the Brinkmann wave solution. We also find new solutions similar to the Brinkmann wave. We prove that the solutions preserve the 1/8 supersymmetry if the gravi-electromagnetic field F, which is a rotational part of gravity, is self-dual.

{"abstract":"We investigate the existence of Taub-NUT/bolt solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity and obtain the general form of these solutions in $d$ dimensions. We find that for all non-extremal NUT solutions of Einstein gravity having no curvature singularity at $r=N$, there exist NUT solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity that contain these solutions in the limit that the Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\\alpha$ goes to zero. Furthermore there are no NUT solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity that yield non-extremal NUT solutions to Einstein gravity having a curvature singularity at $r=N$ in the limit $% \\alpha \\to 0$. Indeed, we have non-extreme NUT solutions in $2+2k$ dimensions with non-trivial fibration only when the $2k$-dimensional base space is chosen to be $\\mathbb{CP}^{2k}$. We also find that the Gauss-Bonnet gravity has extremal NUT solutions whenever the base space is a product of 2-torii with at most a 2-dimensional factor space of positive curvature. Indeed, when the base space has at most one positively curved two dimensional space as one of its factor spaces, then Gauss-Bonnet gravity admits extreme NUT solutions, even though there a curvature singularity exists at $r=N$. We also find that one can have bolt solutions in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with any base space with factor spaces of zero or positive constant curvature.

{"abstract":"We investigate stability of both localized time-periodic coherent states (pulsons) and uniformly distributed coherent states (oscillating condensate) of a real scalar field satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity. The linear analysis of time-dependent parts of perturbations leads to the Hill equation with a singular coefficient. To evaluate the characteristic exponent we extend the Lindemann-Stieltjes method, usually applied to the Mathieu and Lame equations, to the case that the periodic coefficient in the general Hill equation is an unbounded function of time. As a result, we derive the formula for the characteristic exponent and calculate the stability-instability chart. Then we analyze the spatial structure of the perturbations. Using these results we show that the pulsons of any amplitudes, remaining well-localized objects, lose their coherence with time. This means that, strictly speaking, all pulsons of the model considered are unstable. Nevertheless, for the nodeless pulsons the rate of the coherence breaking in narrow ranges of amplitudes is found to be very small, so that such pulsons can be long-lived. Further, we use the obtaned stability-instability chart to examine the Affleck-Dine type condensate.

{"abstract":"An interesting feature of type IIB flux compactifications is the natural presence of strongly warped regions or `throats'. These regions allow for a 5d Randall-Sundrum model interpretation with a large hierarchy between the UV and IR brane. We show that, in the 5d description, the flux stabilization of this hierarchy (or, equivalently, of the brane-to-brane distance) can be understood as an implementation of the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This mechanism relies on the non-trivial bulk profile of the so-called Goldberger-Wise scalar, which in addition has fixed expectation values at the boundaries and thereby stabilizes the size of the 5d interval. The Goldberger-Wise scalar is realized microscopically by the continuously varying flux of the Neveu-Schwarz 2-form potential B_2 on the S^2 cycle in the throat. Its back-reaction on the 5d geometry leads to a significant departure from a pure AdS_5 background. We also find that, for a wide range of parameters, the universal Kaehler modulus of the 10d compactification plays the role of a UV-brane field in the equivalent 5d model. It governs the size of a large 4d curvature term localized at the UV brane.

The Fock space of D3-branes is characterized by a novel exclusion principle (called `Dexclusion' principle), and also by a nonlocality which is consistent with the spacetime uncertainty relation. The Dexclusion principle is realized by composites of two operators, obeying the usual canonical anticommutation relation and the Cuntz algebra, respectively. The nonlocality appears as a consequence of a superselction rule associated with a symmetry which is related to the scale invariance of the super Yang-Mills theory. The entropy of the so-called superstars, with multiple charges, which have been proposed to be geometries corresponding to the condensation of giant gravitons is discussed from our viewpoint and is argued to be consistent with the Dexclusion principle.

We also give a theoretical bound on the brane thickness, in terms of the brane self-consistency of the quantum corrected Einstein equation, namely the requirement that the size of the backreaction should be smaller than that of the background stress-energy at the center of the brane.

For concreteness we concentrate to cases with an SO(4)xSO(2) symmetry preserved by continuous distributions of D3-branes on a disc and on a three-dimensional spherical shell. We compute the expectation value of the Wilson loop operator and confirm the Coulombic behaviour of the heavy quark-antiquark potential in the conformal case.

{"abstract":"We explore here the issue of duality versus spectrum equivalence in abelian vector theories in 2+1 dimensions. Specifically we examine a generalized self-dual (GSD) model where a Maxwell term is added to the self-dual model. A gauge embedding procedure applied to the GSD model leads to a Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory with higher derivatives. We show that the latter contains a ghost mode contrary to the original GSD model. On the other hand, the same embedding procedure can be applied to $N_f$ fermions minimally coupled to the self-dual model. The dual theory corresponds to $N_f$ fermions with an extra Thirring term coupled to the gauge field via a Pauli-like term. By integrating over the fermions at $N_f\\to\\infty$ in both matter coupled theories we obtain effective quadratic theories for the corresponding vector fields. On one hand, we have a nonlocal type of the GSD model. On the other hand, we have a nonlocal form of the MCS theory. It turns out that both theories have the same spectrum and are ghost free. By figuring out why we do not have ghosts in this case we are able to suggest a new master action which takes us from the local GSD to a nonlocal MCS model with the same spectrum of the original GSD model and ghost free. Furthermore, there is a dual map between both theories at classical level which survives quantum correlation functions up to contact terms. The remarks made here may be relevant for other applications of the master action approach.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/01/132","title":"Ghost free dual vector theories in 2+1 dimensions","createdAt":"2005-10-18"}

In the low energy limit, the massless four dimensional graviton obeys the usual 4d equation and is therefore also not generated in a radiation-dominated universe.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics",null],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.72.104018","title":"On graviton production in braneworld cosmology","createdAt":"2005-11-22"}
{"abstract":"We prove that the field equations of supergravity for purely time-dependent backgrounds, which reduce to those of a one--dimensional sigma model, admit a Lax pair representation and are fully integrable. In the case where the effective sigma model is on a maximally split non--compact coset U/H (maximal supergravity or subsectors of lower supersymmetry supergravities) we are also able to construct a completely explicit analytic integration algorithm, adapting a method introduced by Kodama et al in a recent paper. The properties of the general integral are particularly suggestive. Initial data are represented by a pair C_0, h_0 where C_0 is in the CSA of the Lie algebra of U and h_0 in H/W is in the compact subgroup H modded by the Weyl group of U. At asymptotically early and asymptotically late times the Lax operator is always in the Cartan subalgebra and due to the iso-spectral property the two limits differ only by the action of some element of the Weyl group. Hence the entire cosmic evolution can be seen as a billiard scattering with quantized angles defined by the Weyl group. The solution algorithm realizes a map from H}/W into W.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematical Physics","Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.10.030","title":"Integrability of Supergravity Billiards and the generalized Toda lattice equation","createdAt":"2005-10-18"}

The roots themselves display the group structures besides the octonionic roots of E_{8} which form a closed octonion algebra. The automorphism group Aut(F_{4}) of the Dynkin diagram of F_{4} of order 2304, the largest crystallographic group in 4-dimensional Euclidean space, is realized as the direct product of two binary octahedral group of quaternions preserving the quaternionic root system of F_{4}.The Weyl groups of many Lie algebras, such as, G_{2},SO(7),SO(8),SO(9),SU(3)XSU(3) and SP(3)X SU(2) have been constructed as the subgroups of Aut(F_{4}).

{"abstract":"We consider the class of effective supergravity theories from the weakly coupled heterotic string in which local supersymmetry is broken by gaugino condensation in a hidden sector, with dilaton stabilization achieved through corrections to the classical dilaton K\\\"ahler potential. If there is a single hidden condensing (simple) gauge group, the axion is massless (up to contributions from higher dimension operators) above the QCD condensation scale. We show how the standard relation between the axion mass and its Planck scale coupling constant is modified in this class of models due to a contribution to the axion-gluon coupling that appears below the scale of supersymmetry breaking when gluinos are integrated out. In particular there is a point of enhanced symmetry in parameter space where the axion mass is suppressed. We revisit the question of the universal axion as the Peccei-Quinn axion in the light of these results, and find that the strong CP problem is avoided in most compactifications of the weakly coupled heterotic string.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2005.11.009","title":"Is the Universal String Axion the QCD Axion?","createdAt":"2005-10-22"}

Further conditions on the interaction terms arise from the requirement that mass be a scalar. A generic class of theories with interactions that satisfy these conditions is found. The relativistic equations of motion for these theories are presented. We obtain exact circular orbits solutions of the relativistic one-body problem.

By generalizing recent mathematical results to incorporate the B-field and by decoupling the dilaton, we are able to describe the 1-loop beta-functions of the metric and B-field as the components of the gradient of a potential functional on the space of coupling constants. We emphasize a special choice of diffeomorphism gauge generated by the lowest eigenfunction of a certain Schrodinger operator whose potential and kinetic terms evolve along the flow. With this choice, the potential functional is the corresponding lowest eigenvalue, and gives the order alpha' correction to the Weyl anomaly at fixed points of (g(t),B(t)). Since the lowest eigenvalue is monotonic along the flow and reproduces the Weyl anomaly at fixed points, it accords with the c-theorem for flows that remain always in the first-order regime.

{"abstract":"We construct interacting Sp(4,H)/Z_2 pair matrix models inside the compact E6 matrix models. Generally, models based on the compact E6 seem to always include doubly the degrees of freedom that we need physically. In this paper, we propose one solution to this problem. A basic idea is that: `we regard that each point of space-time corresponds to the center of projection of two fundamental figures (i.e. two internal structures), and assume that the projection of these fundamental figures from each point possesses one transformation group as a whole.' Namely, we put emphasis on the `analogy' with the projective geometry. Given that the whole symmetry is compact E6 * Gauge, the space $(\\Vec{\\mathfrak{J}_H} \\oplus i \\Vec{H^3}) \\times \\Vec{\\mathcal{G}}$ is promising as two subspaces seen from such a viewpoint. When this situation is seen from the standpoint of Klein's Erlangen Program, each fundamental figure should also have an independent transformation group. The symmetry corresponding to this is Sp(4,H)/Z_2 * Gauge. This is ensured by the introduction of the Yokota mapping Y. As a consequence, we result in the picture of interacting pair universes which are being pi/2[rad]-phase-shifted. This picture is applicable to all the models based on the compact E6, which may be not only matrix models but also field theories. An interacting bi-Chern-Simons model is provided when this result is applied to our previous matrix model.

{"abstract":"We show that planar cal N=4 Yang-Mills theory at zero 't Hooft coupling can be efficiently described in terms of 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic oscillators. We show that these oscillators can serve as world-sheet variables, the string bits, of a discretized string. There is a one to one correspondence between the on shell gauge invariant words of the free Y-M theory and the states in the oscillators' Hilbert space, obeying a local gauge and cyclicity constraints. The planar two-point functions and the three-point functions of all gauge invariant words are obtained by the simple delta-function overlap of the corresponding discrete string world sheet. At first order in the 't Hooft coupling, i.e. at one-loop in the Y-M theory, the logarithmic corrections of the planar two-point and the three-point functions can be incorporated by nearest neighbour interactions among the discretized string bits. In the SU(2) sub-sector we show that the one-loop corrections to the structure constants can be uniquely determined by the symmetries of the bit picture. For the SU(2) sub-sector we construct a gauged, linear, discrete world-sheet model for the oscillators, with only nearest neighbour couplings, which reproduces the anomalous dimension Hamiltonian up to two loops. This model also obeys BMN scaling to all loops.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/04/014","title":"Towards a string bit formulation of N=4 super Yang-Mills","createdAt":"2006-02-20"}
{"abstract":"The analysis of geometric phases is briefly reviewed by emphasizing various gauge symmetries involved. The analysis of geometric phases associated with level crossing is reduced to the familiar diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the second quantized formulation. A hidden local gauge symmetry becomes explicit in this formulation and specifies physical observables; the choice of a basis set which specifies the coordinates in the functional space is arbitrary in the second quantization, and a sub-class of coordinate transformations, which keeps the form of the action invariant, is recognized as the gauge symmetry. It is shown that the hidden local symmetry provides a basic concept which replaces the notions of parallel transport and holonomy. We also point out that our hidden local gauge symmetry is quite different from a gauge symmetry used by Aharonov and Anandan in their definition of non-adiabatic phases.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0510265","title":"Gauge symmetries in geometric phases","createdAt":"2005-10-31"}

The geometric description proposed in this paper provides an intermediate step between the free purely twistorial model in two-twistor space in which both spacetime and four-momenta vectors are composite, and the standard particle model, where both spacetime and four-momenta vectors are elementary. We quantize the model and find explicitly the first-quantized wavefunctions describing relativistic particles with mass, spin and electric charge.

By including spatial variations we are able to simulate the effect of currents and the gauge fields which they source. We identify two different regimes where the inhomogeneities have opposite effects, one where they aid the system to complete the conifold transition and another where they hinder it.

{"abstract":"If gravitons are super-strong interacting particles and the low-temperature graviton background exists, the basic cosmological conjecture about the Dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false. In this case, a full magnitude of cosmological redshift would be caused by interactions of photons with gravitons. Non-forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional relaxation of any photonic flux. It gives a possibility of another interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. These facts may implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm. A quantum mechanism of classical gravity based on an existence of this sea of gravitons is described for the Newtonian limit. This mechanism needs graviton pairing and \"an atomic structure\" of matter for working it, and leads to the time asymmetry. If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the nature, then an existence of black holes contradicts to Einstein's equivalence principle. It is shown that in this approach the two fundamental constants - Hubble's and Newton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The theoretical value of the Hubble constant is computed. In this approach, every massive body would be decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the Pioneer 10 anomaly.

{"abstract":"This is the 5-th paper in the series devoted to explicit formulating of the rules needed to manage an effective field theory of strong interactions in S-matrix sector. We discuss the principles of constructing the meaningful perturbation series and formulate two basic ones: uniformity and summability. Relying on these principles one obtains the bootstrap conditions which restrict the allowed values of the physical (observable) parameters appearing in the extended perturbation scheme built for a given localizable effective theory. The renormalization prescriptions needed to fix the finite parts of counterterms in such a scheme can be divided into two subsets: minimal -- needed to fix the S-matrix, and non-minimal -- for eventual calculation of Green functions; in this paper we consider only the minimal one. In particular, it is shown that in theories with the amplitudes which asymptotic behavior is governed by known Regge intercepts, the system of independent renormalization conditions only contains those fixing the counterterm vertices with $n \\leq 3$ lines, while other prescriptions are determined by self-consistency requirements. Moreover, the prescriptions for $n \\leq 3$ cannot be taken arbitrary: an infinite number of bootstrap conditions should be respected. The concept of localizability, introduced and explained in this article, is closely connected with the notion of resonance in the framework of perturbative QFT.

The gauge group has a block diagonal symplectic embedding and is a semi-direct product of the 5D gauge group K with a Heisenberg group of dimension (2P+1), where 2P is the number of tensor fields in five dimensions. There exists an infinite family of theories, thus obtained, whose gauge groups are pp-wave contractions of the simple noncompact groups of type SO*(2M). If, on the other hand, the 5D gauge group does mix the 5D tensor and vector fields, the resulting 4D theory is dual to a 4D YMESGT whose gauge group does, in general,NOT have a block diagonal symplectic embedding and involves additional topological terms. The scalar potentials of the dimensionally reduced theories naturally have some of the ingredients that were found necessary for stable de Sitter ground states. We comment on the relation between the known 5D and 4D, N=2 supergravities with stable de Sitter ground states.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/01/168","title":"The R-map and the Coupling of N=2 Tensor Multiplets in 5 and 4 Dimensions","createdAt":"2005-11-02"}

{"abstract":"We present a comparative analysis of localization of 4D gravity on a non Z_2-symmetric scalar thick brane in both a 5-dimensional Riemannian space time and a pure geometric Weyl integrable manifold. This work was mainly motivated by the hypothesis which claims that Weyl geometries mimic quantum behaviour classically. We start by obtaining a classical 4-dimensional Poincare invariant thick brane solution which does not respect Z_2-symmetry along the (non-)compact extra dimension. The scalar energy density of our field configuration represents several series of thick branes with positive and negative energy densities centered at y_0. The only qualitative difference we have encountered when comparing both frames is that the scalar curvature of the Riemannian manifold turns out to be singular for the found solution, whereas its Weylian counterpart presents a regular behaviour. By studying the transverse traceless modes of the fluctuations of the classical backgrounds, we recast their equations into a Schroedinger's equation form with a volcano potential of finite bottom (in both frames). By solving the Schroedinger equation for the massless zero mode m^2=0 we obtain a single bound state which represents a stable 4-dimensional graviton in both frames. We also get a continuum gapless spectrum of KK states with positive m^2>0 that are suppressed at y_0, turning into continuum plane wave modes as \"y\" approaches spatial infinity. We show that for the considered solution to our setup, the potential is always bounded and cannot adopt the form of a well with infinite walls; thus, we do not get a discrete spectrum of KK states, and we conclude that the claim that Weylian structures mimic, classically, quantum behaviour does not constitute a generic feature of these geometric manifolds.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/101","title":"4D gravity localized in non Z_2-symmetric thick branes","createdAt":"2005-11-03"}

{"abstract":"We investigate strong-to-weak coupling transitions in D=2+1 SU(N->oo) gauge theories, by simulating lattice theories with a Wilson plaquette action. We find that there is a strong-to-weak coupling cross-over in the lattice theory that appears to become a third-order phase transition at N=oo, in a manner that is essentially identical to the Gross-Witten transition in the D=1+1 SU(oo) lattice gauge theory. There is also evidence for a second order transition at N=oo at approximately the same coupling, which is connected with centre monopoles (instantons) and so analogues to the first order bulk transition that occurs in D=3+1 lattice gauge theories for N>4. We show that as the lattice spacing is reduced, the N=oo gauge theory on a finite 3-torus suffers a sequence of (apparently) first-order ZN symmetry breaking transitions associated with each of the tori (ordered by size). We discuss how these transitions can be understood in terms of a sequence of deconfining transitions on ever-more dimensionally reduced gauge theories.We investigate whether the trace of the Wilson loop has a non-analyticity in the coupling at some critical area, but find no evidence for this although, just as in D=1+1,the eigenvalue density of a Wilson loop forms a gap at N=oo for a critical trace. The physical implications of this are unclear.The gap formation is a special case of a remarkable similarity between the eigenvalue spectra of Wilson loops in D=1+1 and D=2+1 (and indeed D=3+1): for the same value of the trace, the eigenvalue spectra are nearly identical.This holds for finite as well as infinite N; irrespective of the Wilson loop size in lattice units; and for Polyakov as well as Wilson loops.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.74.125010","title":"Strong to weak coupling transitions of SU(N) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions","createdAt":"2006-03-21"}

It is known that after topological twisting partition functions of N}>1 supersymmetric theories on N.C.

At the large N.C. parameter limit, the Seiberg-Witten monopole equations are reduced to ADHM equations with the Dirac equation reduced to 0 dimension. The equations are equivalent to the dimensional reduction of non-Abelian U(N) Seiberg-Witten monopole equations in N -> \\infty.

{"abstract":"A new local, covariant ``counter-term'' is used to construct a variational principle for asymptotically flat spacetimes in any spacetime dimension $ d \\ge 4$. The new counter-term makes direct contact with more familiar background subtraction procedures, but is a local algebraic function of the boundary metric and Ricci curvature. The corresponding action satisfies two important properties required for a proper treatment of semi-classical issues and, in particular, to connect with any dual non-gravitational description of asymptotically flat space. These properties are that 1) the action is finite on-shell and 2) asymptotically flat solutions are stationary points under {\\it all} variations preserving asymptotic flatness; i.e., not just under variations of compact support. Our definition of asymptotic flatness is sufficiently general to allow the magentic part of the Weyl tensor to be of the same order as the electric part and thus, for d=4, to have non-vanishing NUT charge. Definitive results are demonstrated when the boundary is either a cylindrical or a hyperbolic (i.e., de Sitter space) representation of spacelike infinity ($i^0$), and partial results are provided for more general representations of $i^0$. For the cylindrical or hyperbolic representations of $i^0$, similar results are also shown to hold for both a counter-term proportional to the square-root of the boundary Ricci scalar and for a more complicated counter-term suggested previously by Kraus, Larsen, and Siebelink. Finally, we show that such actions lead, via a straightforward computation, to conserved quantities at spacelike infinity which agree with, but are more general than, the usual (e.g., ADM) results.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1088/0264-9381/23/9/010","title":"Holographic Renormalization of Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes","createdAt":"2006-01-13"}

It has been claimed that there is a disagreement for the free energy between the spacetime and the dual matrix model. Here we find that this discrepancy is sensitive to how the cutoff is implemented on the spacetime side. In particular, the disagreement is resolved once we put the cutoff at a fixed distance away from the horizon, as opposed to a fixed position in space. Furthermore, the mass and the entropy of the black hole itself add up to an analytic contribution to the free energy, which is precisely reproduced by the 0A matrix model. We also use results from the 0A matrix model to predict the next to leading order contribution to the entropy of the black hole. Finally, we note that the black hole is characterized by a Hagedorn growth in its density of states below the Hagedorn temperature. This, together with other results, suggests there is a phase transition at this temperature.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/05/032","title":"The stringy nature of the 2d type-0A black hole","createdAt":"2006-05-09"}

{"abstract":"Soon after the Yang-Mills work, the gauge invariance became one of the basic principles in the elementary particles theory. The gauge invariance idea is that Lagrangian has to be invariant not only with respect to the coordinates transformations corresponding to the Lorentz group (external symmetry). It is supposed that Lagrangian has also to be invariant with respect to wave functions (not coordinates) transformations corresponding to some additional groups (so-called \"internal symmetry groups\"). Useful though this idea is, there is no satisfactory understanding of the above additional symmetries origin, and the gauge invariance is considered as an auxiliary theoretical hypotheses. We propose a new, topological interpretation of the basic quantum mechanical equation -- the Dirac equation, and within the framework of this interpretation the notions of internal symmetry and gauge invariance bear a simple geometrical meaning and are natural consequences of the basic principles of the proposed geometrical description. According to this interpretation the Dirac equation proves to be the group-theoretical relation that accounts for the symmetry properties of a specific 4-manifold -- localized microscopic deviation of the space-time geometry from the Euclidean one. This manifold covering space plays the role of the internal space, and the covering space automorphism group plays the role of the gauge group.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0511118","title":"Topological Interpretation of the Dirac Equation and Geometrical Foundations of the Gauge Invariance Idea","createdAt":"2005-11-10"}

In the first part noncommutative spaces created by star-products are studied. We are able to identify differential operators that still have an undeformed Leibniz rule and can therefore be gauged much in the same way as in the canonical case. By linking these derivations to frames (vielbeins) of a curved manifold, it is possible to formulate noncommutative gauge theories that admit nonconstant noncommutativity and go to gauge theory on curved spacetime in the commutative limit. We are also able to express the dependence of the noncommutative quantities on their corresponding commutative counterparts by using Seiberg-Witten maps. In the second part we study noncommutative gauge theory in the matrix theory approach. There, the noncommutative space is a finite dimensional matrix algebra (fuzzy space) which emerges as the ground state of a matrix action, the fluctuations around this ground state creating the gauge theory. This gauge theory is finite, goes to gauge theory on a 4-dimensional manifold in the commutative limit and can also be used to regularize the noncommutative gauge theory of the canonical case. In particular, we are able to match parts of the known instanton sector of the canonical case with the instantons of the finite theory.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0511119","title":"Noncommutative Gauge Theory beyond the Canonical Case","createdAt":"2005-11-21"}

Obtaining an ''embedded'' sequence of cubic equations, it is shown that it is possible to parametrize also a multi-variable cubic curve, which is not the standardly known case from algebraic geometry. Algebraic solutions for the contravariant metric tensor components are derived and the parametrization is extended in respect to the covariant components as well. It has been speculated that corrections to the extradimensional volume in theories with extra dimensions should be taken into account, due to the non-euclidean nature of the Lobachevsky space. It was shown that the mechanism of exponential \"damping\" of the physical mass in the higher-dimensional brane theory may be more complicated due to the variety of contravariant metric components for a spacetime with a given constant curvature. The invariance of the low-energy type I string theory effective action is considered in respect not only to the known procedure of compactification to a four-dimensional spacetime, but also in respect to rescaling the contravariant metric components. As a result, instead of the simple algebraic relations between the parameters in the string action, quasilinear differential equations in partial derivatives are obtained, which have been solved for the most simple case.

We show that for a positive cosmological constant this state is unstable -- it can rapidly transition to a de Sitter universe providing a new unsuppressed channel for inflation. For a negative cosmological constant the space-time flat solutions is stable.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1016/j.physletb.2006.03.002","title":"Quantum Cosmology of Classically Constrained Gravity","createdAt":"2005-11-13"}

The brane geometries are de Sitter and the bulk is a warped geometry supported by a positive cosmological constant as well as a 2-form flux. We show that at low energies ordinary gravity is reproduced, and explicitly compute the leading corrections from six dimensional effects. After regulating the brane we find a logarithmic dependence on the cutoff scale of brane physics even for modes whose frequency is much less than this energy scale. We discuss the possibility that this dependence can be renormalized into bulk or brane counterterms in line with effective field theory expectations.

As an explicit example, we analyze in detail a quantum mechanical model proposed by M. Stone, which is supposed to show the above connection. We show that the geometric term in the model, which is topologically trivial for any finite time interval $T$, corresponds to the so-called ``normal naive term'' in field theory and has nothing to do with the anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino term. In the fundamental level, the difference between the two notions is stated as follows: The topology of gauge fields leads to level crossing in the fermionic sector in the case of chiral anomaly and the {\\em failure} of the adiabatic approximation is essential in the analysis, whereas the (potential) level crossing in the matter sector leads to the topology of the Berry phase only when the precise adiabatic approximation holds.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Quantum Physics"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.73.025017","title":"Quantum anomaly and geometric phase; their basic differences","createdAt":"2006-01-08"}

This setup allows us to discuss the quantum-mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the final amplitude of the well-defined zero mode. Using the Wronskian formulation, we numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves, and find that the effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the Kaluza-Klein modes is subdominant, contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum. Thus it is confirmed that the damping due to the Kaluza-Klein mode generation and the enhancement due to the modification of the background Friedmann equation are the two dominant effects, but they cancel each other, leading to the same spectral tilt as the standard four-dimensional result.

This suggests the existence of multiple basins for flux vacua and domain walls in the landscape for a fixed flux and at interior points in moduli space.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/03/020","title":"New Attractors and Area Codes","createdAt":"2006-01-12"}

The question is whether the system remains stable before and after Inflation, when the spacetime geometry is distorted away from the inflationary form but still has flat spatial sections.

This paper compares both forms of a non-Hermitian $ix^3$ quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian and demonstrates that it is much harder to perform calculations in the Hermitian theory because the perturbation series for the Hermitian Hamiltonian is constructed from divergent Feynman graphs. For the Hermitian version of the theory, dimensional continuation is used to regulate the divergent graphs that contribute to the ground-state energy and the one-point Green's function. The results that are obtained are identical to those found much more simply and without divergences in the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonian.

{"abstract":"We propose a mechanism for solving the horizon and entropy problems of standard cosmology which does not make use of cosmological inflation. Crucial ingredients of our scenario are brane gases, extra dimensions, and a confining potential due to string gas effects which becomes dominant at string-scale brane separations. The initial conditions are taken to be a statistically homogeneous and isotropic hot brane gas in a space in which all spatial dimensions are of string scale. The extra dimensions which end up as the internal ones are orbifolded. The hot brane gas leads to an initial phase (Phase 1) of isotropic expansion. Once the bulk energy density has decreased sufficiently, a weak confining potential between the two orbifold fixed planes begins to dominate, leading to a contraction of the extra spatial dimensions (Phase 2). String modes which contain momentum about the dimensions perpendicular to the orbifold fixed planes provide a repulsive potential which prevents the two orbifold fixed planes from colliding. The radii of the extra dimensions stabilize, and thereafter our three spatial dimensions expand as in standard cosmology. The energy density after the stabilization of the extra dimensions is of string scale, whereas the spatial volume has greatly increased during Phases 1 and 2, thus leading to a non-inflationary solution of the horizon and entropy problems.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics",null,"High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/01/074","title":"The Confining Heterotic Brane Gas: A Non-Inflationary Solution to the Entropy and Horizon Problems of Standard Cosmology","createdAt":"2005-12-06"}

This has been observed in functional and also in lattice calculations. The linear rise of the quark-anti-quark potential and thus quark confinement on the other hand seems to be connected to topological excitations. To investigate whether a connection exists between both aspects of confinement, the spectrum of the Faddeev-Popov operator in two topological background fields is determined analytically in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is found that a single instanton, which is likely irrelevant to quark confinement, also sustains only few additional zero-modes. A center vortex, which is likely important to quark confinement, is found to contribute much more zero-modes, provided the vortex is of sufficient flux.

We argue that T-duality acts in our class of theories, including those cases without isometries in which the conventional Buscher rules cannot be applied, and that these generalised T-dualities can take T-folds or flux compactifications on twisted tori to examples of the new non-geometric backgrounds. We show that the new class of non-geometric backgrounds and the generalised T-dualities arise naturally in string field theory, and are readily formulated in terms of a doubled geometry, related to generalised geometry. At special points in moduli space, some of the non-geometric constructions become equivalent to asymmetric orbifolds which are known to provide consistent string backgrounds.

{"abstract":"In order to produce a low energy effective field theory from a string model, it is necessary to specify a vacuum state. In order that this vacuum be supersymmetric, it is well known that all field expectation values must be along so-called flat directions, leaving the F- and D-terms of the scalar potential to be zero. The situation becomes particularly interesting when one attempts to realize such directions while assigning VEVS to fields transforming under non-Abelian representations of the gauge group. Since the expectation value is now shared among multiple components of a field, satisfaction of flatness becomes an inherently geometrical problem in the group space. Furthermore, the possibility emerges that a single seemingly dangerous F-term might experience a self-cancellation among its components. The hope exists that the geometric language can provide an intuitive and immediate recognition of when the D and F conditions are simultaneously compatible, as well as a powerful tool for their comprehensive classification. This is the avenue explored in this paper, and applied to the cases of SU(2) and SO(2N), relevant respectively to previous attempts at reproducing the MSSM and the flipped SU(5) GUT. Geometrical interpretation of non-Abelian flat directions finds application to M-theory through the recent conjecture of equivalence between D-term strings and wrapped D-branes of Type II theory. Knowledge of the geometry of the flat direction \"landscape\" of a D-term string model could yield information about the dual brane model.

{"abstract":"Electrically charged solutions for gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field are found in four dimensions in the presence of a cosmological constant. If a quartic self-interaction term for the scalar field is considered, there is a solution describing an asymptotically locally AdS charged black hole dressed with a scalar field that is regular on and outside the event horizon, which is a surface of negative constant curvature. This black hole can have negative mass, which is bounded from below for the extremal case, and its causal structure shows that the solution describes a \"black hole inside a black hole\". The thermodynamics of the non-extremal black hole is analyzed in the grand canonical ensemble. The entropy does not follow the area, and there is an effective Newton constant which depends on the value of the scalar field at the horizon. If the base manifold is locally flat, the solution has no electric charge, and the scalar field has a vanishing stress-energy tensor so that it dresses a locally AdS spacetime with a nut at the origin.

{"abstract":"We present some partial results on the general infrared behavior of bulk-critical 1-d quantum systems with boundary. We investigate whether the boundary entropy, s(T), is always bounded below as the temperature T decreases towards 0, and whether the boundary always becomes critical in the IR limit. We show that failure of these properties is equivalent to certain seemingly pathological behaviors far from the boundary. One of our approaches uses real time methods, in which locality at the boundary is expressed by analyticity in the frequency. As a preliminary, we use real time methods to prove again that the boundary beta-function is the gradient of the boundary entropy, which implies that s(T) decreases with T. The metric on the space of boundary couplings is interpreted as the renormalized susceptibility matrix of the boundary, made finite by a natural subtraction.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Statistical Mechanics"],"doi":"10.1088/1742-5468/2006/03/P03014","title":"Infrared properties of boundaries in 1-d quantum systems","createdAt":"2005-12-01"}

The quantization of the chromodynamics was perfectly performed in the both of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian path-integral formalisms by using the Lagrangian undetermined multiplier method. In this paper, It is shown that the quantum theory is invariant with respect to a kind of BRST-transformations. From the BRST-invariance of the theory, the Ward-Takahashi identities satisfied by the generating functionals of full Green functions, connected Green functions and proper vertex functions are successively derived. As an application of the above Ward-Takahashi identities, the Ward-Takahashi identities obeyed by the massive gluon and ghost particle propagators and various proper vertices are derived and based on these identities, the propagators and vertices are perfectly renormalized.

{"abstract":"Bouncing cosmologies, suggested by String/M-theory, may provide an alternative to standard inflation to account for the origin of inhomogeneities in our universe. The fundamental question regards the correct way to evolve the scalar perturbations through the bounce. In this work, we determine the evolution of perturbations and the final spectrum for an arbitrary (spatially flat) bouncing cosmology, with the only assumption that the bounce is governed by a single physical scale. In particular, we find that the spectrum of the pre-bounce growing mode of the Bardeen potential (which is scale-invariant in some limit, and thus compatible with observations) survives unaltered in the post-bounce only if the comoving pressure perturbation is directly proportional to the Bardeen potential rather than its Laplacian, as for any known form of ordinary matter. If some new physics acting at the bounce justifies such relation, then bouncing cosmologies are entitled to become a real viable alternative for the generation of the observed inhomogeneities. Our treatment also includes some class of models with extra-dimensions, whereas we show that bounces induced by positive spatial curvature are structurally different from all bounces in spatially flat universes, requiring a distinct analysis.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1088/1475-7516/2006/02/009","title":"General solution for scalar perturbations in bouncing cosmologies","createdAt":"2005-12-06"}

Their interpretation as exact gravitational waves propagating on AdS restrict the source to behave as a pure radiation field. We show that the related pure radiation constraints single out a unique self-interaction potential depending on one coupling constant. For a vanishing coupling constant, this potential reduces to a mass term with a mass fixed in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter. This mass dependence allows the existence of several free cases including massless and tachyonic sources. There even exists a particular value of the nonminimal coupling parameter for which the corresponding mass exactly compensates the contribution generated by the negative scalar curvature, producing a genuinely massless field in this curved background. The self-interacting case is studied in detail for the conformal coupling. The resulting gravitational wave is formed by the superposition of the free and the self-interaction contributions, except for a critical value of the coupling constant where a non-perturbative effect relating the strong and weak regimes of the source appears.

{"abstract":"Solutions of type IIB supergravity which preserve half of the supersymmetries have a dual description in terms of free fermions, as elucidated by the \"bubbling AdS\" construction of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena. In this paper we study the half-BPS geometry associated with a gas of free fermions in thermodynamic equilibrium obeying the Fermi-Dirac distribution. We consider both regimes of low and high temperature. In the former case, we present a detailed computation of the ADM mass of the supergravity solution and find agreement with the thermal energy of the fermions. The solution has a naked null singularity and, by general arguments, is expected to develop a finite area horizon once stringy corrections are included. By introducing a stretched horizon, we propose a way to match the entropy of the fermions with the entropy of the geometry in the low temperature regime. In the opposite limit of high temperature, the solution resembles a dilute gas of D3 branes. Also in this case the ADM mass of the geometry agrees with the thermal energy of the fermions.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2007/01/067","title":"Half-BPS Geometries and Thermodynamics of Free Fermions","createdAt":"2007-03-07"}
{"abstract":"N-flation is a promising embedding of inflation in string theory in which many string axions combine to drive inflation. We characterize the dynamics of a general N-flation model with non-degenerate axion masses. Although the precise mass of a single axion depends on compactification details in a complicated way, the distribution of masses can be computed with very limited knowledge of microscopics: the shape of the mass distribution is an emergent property. We use random matrix theory to show that a typical N-flation model has a spectrum of masses distributed according to the Marchenko-Pastur law. This distribution depends on a single parameter, the number of axions divided by the dimension of the moduli space. We use this result to describe the inflationary dynamics and phenomenology of a general N-flation model. We produce an ensemble of models and use numerical integration to track the axions' evolution and the resulting scalar power spectrum. For realistic initial conditions, the power spectrum is considerably more red than in single-field $m^2\\phi^2$ inflation. We conclude that random matrix models of N-flation are surprisingly tractable and have a rich phenomenology that differs in testable ways from that of single-field $m^2\\phi^2$ inflation.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1475-7516/2006/05/018","title":"Random Matrices and the Spectrum of N-flation","createdAt":"2006-04-10"}

This is due to the presence of the charged fields (W^{\\pm}).

These traces, which determine the dynamics at finite N, have a surprisingly simple form. The energy function is given by a quotient of a free multi-particle system, where the dynamics of the individual particles are related by a simple scaling of space and time. We show that exotic bounces of the kind seen in the 1/N expansion do not exist at finite N. The dependence of the time of collapse on N is not monotonic.

In addition to these solutions, we here show the existence of L7-branes of CP^3 \\times S^1 geometry, introducing extra potentials to the M(atrix) theory Lagrangian. As in the cases of k=1,2, the L7-branes (corresponding to k=3) also break the supersymmetries of M(atrix) theory. The extra potentials are introduced such that the energy of a static L7-brane solution becomes finite in the large N limit where N represents the matrix dimension of fuzzy CP^3. As a consequence, fluctuations from the L7-branes are suppressed, which effectively describes compactification of M(atrix) theory down to 7 dimensions. We show that one of the extra potentials can be considered as a matrix-valued 7-form. The presence of the 7-form in turn supports a possibility of Freund-Rubin type compactification.

In the large $N$ limit we find a peculiar phase structure in the model. At weak string coupling the theory reduces to the trivial sector and the topological string partition function on the resolved conifold is reproduced in this regime. At a certain critical point, instantons are enhanced and the theory undergoes a phase transition into a strong coupling regime.

{"abstract":"The holographic duality can be extended to include quantum theories with broken coordinate invariance leading to the appearance of the gravitational anomalies. On the gravity side one adds the gravitational Chern-Simons term to the bulk action which gauge invariance is only up to the boundary terms. We analyze in detail how the gravitational anomalies originate from the modified Einstein equations in the bulk. As a side observation we find that the gravitational Chern-Simons functional has interesting conformal properties. It is invariant under conformal transformations. Moreover, its metric variation produces conformal tensor which is a generalization of the Cotton tensor to dimension $d+1=4k-1, k\\in Z$. We calculate the modification of the holographic stress-energy tensor that is due to the Chern-Simons term and use the bulk Einstein equations to find its divergence and thus reproduce the gravitational anomaly. Explicit calculation of the anomaly is carried out in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=6$. The result of the holographic calculation is compared with that of the descent method and agreement is found. The gravitational Chern-Simons term originates by Kaluza-Klein mechanism from a one-loop modification of M-theory action. This modification is discussed in the context of the gravitational anomaly in six-dimensional $(2,0)$ theory. The agreement with earlier conjectured anomaly is found.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null,"Differential Geometry"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/07/003","title":"Holographic Description of Gravitational Anomalies","createdAt":"2006-06-27"}

The latter are naturally defined for the circle case since, as it was shown in the past, the background corresponds to an orbifold of the exact conformal field theory coset model SU(2)/U(1) times SL(2,R)/U(1). We explore the possibility to define parafermionic objects at generic points of the ellipsoidal families of backgrounds away from the circle point.

Large-N_c extrapolation of pure lattice gauge theory data, in both 3 and 4 dimensions, indicates that there are more worldsheet degrees of freedom than the purely massless transverse ones of the free Nambu-Goto string.

{"abstract":"The subject of this thesis are various ways to construct four-dimensional quantum field theories from string theory. In a first part we study the generation of a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, coupled to an adjoint chiral superfield, from type IIB string theory on non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, with D-branes wrapping certain subcycles. The low energy limit of this non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained from a second non-compact Calabi-Yau geometry, which is related to the first one through a geometric transition. In particular, the effective superpotential governing the vacuum structure of the gauge theory can be obtained from integrals on a Calabi-Yau manifold. These integrals in turn are related to matrix model quantities and one therefore can use the matrix model to learn something about the gauge theory vacua. The second part of this work covers the generation of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, carrying several important characteristic features of the standard model, from compactifications of eleven-dimensional supergravity on G_2-manifolds. We discuss anomaly cancellation through inflow in the case of conical singularities, present an explicit compact manifold with two conical singularities and weak G_2-holonomy, and review the anomaly cancellation mechanism in the context of M-theory on the interval.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0512285","title":"Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from String Theory","createdAt":"2005-12-22"}
{"abstract":"We discuss the renormalizability of the massless Thirring model in terms of the causal fermion Green functions and correlation functions of left-right fermion densities. We obtain the most general expressions for the causal two-point Green function and correlation function of left-right fermion densities with dynamical dimensions of fermion fields, parameterised by two parameters. The region of variation of these parameters is constrained by the positive definiteness of the norms of the wave functions of the states related to components of the fermion vector current. We show that the dynamical dimensions of fermion fields calculated for causal Green functions and correlation functions of left-right fermion densities can be made equal. This implies the renormalizability of the massless Thirring model in the sense that the ultra-violet cut-off dependence, appearing in the causal fermion Green functions and correlation functions of left-right fermion densities, can be removed by renormalization of the wave function of the massless Thirring fermion fields only.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/0305-4470/39/35/009","title":"On renormalizability of the massless Thirring model","createdAt":"2006-05-09"}

{"abstract":"We examine the solution generating symmetries by which Lunin and Maldacena have generated the gravity duals of beta-deformations of certain field theories. We identify the O(2,2,R) matrix, which acts on the background matrix E=g+B, where g and B are the metric and the B-field of the undeformed background, respectively. This simplifies the calculations and makes some features of the deformed backgrounds more transparent. We also find a new three-parameter deformation of the Sasaki-Einstein manifolds T^{1,1} and Y^{p,q}. Following the recent literature on the three-parameter deformation of AdS_5 \\times S^5, one would expect that our new solutions should correspond to non-supersymmetric marginal deformations of the relevant dual field theories.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory"],"doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/02/026","title":"Lunin-Maldacena Deformations With Three Parameters","createdAt":"2006-02-24"}
{"abstract":"We construct quantum effective action in spacetime with branes/boundaries. This construction is based on the reduction of the underlying Neumann type boundary value problem for the propagator of the theory to that of the much more manageable Dirichlet problem. In its turn, this reduction follows from the recently suggested Neumann-Dirichlet duality which we extend beyond the tree level approximation. In the one-loop approximation this duality suggests that the functional determinant of the differential operator subject to Neumann boundary conditions in the bulk factorizes into the product of its Dirichlet counterpart and the functional determinant of a special operator on the brane -- the inverse of the brane-to-brane propagator. As a byproduct of this relation we suggest a new method for surface terms of the heat kernel expansion. This method allows one to circumvent well-known difficulties in heat kernel theory on manifolds with boundaries for a wide class of generalized Neumann boundary conditions. In particular, we easily recover several lowest order surface terms in the case of Robin and oblique boundary conditions. We briefly discuss multi-loop applications of the suggested Dirichlet reduction and the prospects of constructing the universal background field method for systems with branes/boundaries, analogous to the Schwinger-DeWitt technique.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.73.066012","title":"Quantum Effective Action in Spacetimes with Branes and Boundaries","createdAt":"2006-03-15"}
{"abstract":"The hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E10 has repeatedly been suggested to play a crucial role in the symmetry structure of M-theory. Recently, following the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the supergravity fields near a cosmological singularity, this question has received a new impulse. It has been argued that one way to exhibit the symmetry was to rewrite the supergravity equations as the equations of motion of the non-linear sigma model E10/K(E10). This attempt, in line with the established result that the scalar fields which appear in the toroidal compactification down to three spacetime dimensions form the coset E8/SO(16), was verified for the first bosonic levels in a level expansion of the theory.

{"abstract":"We calculate the energy of a static string in an AdS slice between two D3-branes with orbifold condition. The energy for configurations with endpoints on a brane grows linearly for large separation between these points. The derivative of the energy has a discontinuity at some critical separation. Choosing a particular position for one of the branes we find configurations with smooth energy. In the limit where the other brane goes to infinity the energy has a Coulombian behaviour for short separations and can be identified with the Cornell potential for a quark anti-quark pair. This identification leads to effective values for the AdS radius, the string tension and the position of the infrared brane. These results suggest an approximate duality between static strings in an AdS slice and a heavy quark anti-quark configuration in a confining gauge theory.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"doi":"10.1103/PhysRevD.73.106006 10.1103/PhysRevD.74.089903","title":"Static strings in Randall-Sundrum scenarios and the quark anti-quark potential","createdAt":"2006-04-10"}

{"abstract":"We present a modified version of the boundary counterterm method for removing divergences from the action of an asymptotically $AdS$ spacetime. The standard approach renders the action finite but leaves diffeomorphism invariance partially broken if the dimension of the spacetime is odd. We show that this symmetry is restored by a new boundary counterterm, needed to cancel a divergence that appears in dimensional regularization. The result is a finite, diffeomorphism invariant action appropriate for gravitational physics. As an example we calculate the action for the Kerr-$AdS_5$ black hole. Unlike the standard boundary counterterm results, our action yields conserved charges that are consistent with the first law of black hole thermodynamics.","keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null],"doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0512297","title":"A New Boundary Counterterm for Asymptotically AdS Spacetimes","createdAt":"2005-12-22"}
