We present a sigma model for biKaehler geometry that is topological in the following sense: i) the action is invariant under a fermionic symmetry delta; ii) delta is nilpotent on shell; iii) the action is delta--exact on shell up to a topological term; iv) the resulting field theory depends only on a subset of the target space geometrical data. The biKaehler sigma model is obtainable by gauge fixing the Hitchin model with generalized Kaehler target space. It further contains the customary A topological sigma model as a particular case. However, it is not seemingly related to the (2,2) supersymmetric biKaehler sigma model by twisting in general.","doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/01/041","title":"A topological sigma model of biKaehler geometry","createdAt":"2005-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","__v":0}{"keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Differential Geometry","Quantum Algebra"],"_id":"5b2243f2fe146a0d3f04e94e","abstract":"It has been shown recently that extended supersymmetry in twisted first-order sigma models is related to twisted generalized complex geometry in the target.

We express the condition for ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry in terms of differential equations for these spinors. In an equivalent formulation, working locally in the vicinity of any point in $X$ in terms of a `preferred' $Spin(7)$ structure, we show that the requirement of ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry amounts to solving for the intrinsic torsion and all irreducible flux components, except for the one lying in the $\\bf{27}$ of $Spin(7)$, in terms of the warp factor and a one-form $L$ on $X$ (not necessarily nowhere-vanishing) constructed as a $\\xi$ bilinear; in addition, $L$ is constrained to satisfy a pair of differential equations. The formalism based on the group $Spin(7)$ is the most suitable language in which to describe supersymmetric compactifications on eight-manifolds of $Spin(7)$ structure, and/or small-flux perturbations around supersymmetric compactifications on manifolds of $Spin(7)$ holonomy.","doi":"10.1088/1126-6708/2006/04/027","title":"M-theory on eight-manifolds revisited: N=1 supersymmetry and generalized Spin(7) structures","createdAt":"2006-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","__v":0}{"keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory","Differential Geometry"],"_id":"5b2243f2fe146a0d3f04e8d4","abstract":"The geometric evolution equations provide new ways to address a variety of non-linear problems in Riemannian geometry, and, at the same time, they enjoy numerous physical applications, most notably within the renormalization group analysis of non-linear sigma models and in general relativity.

Here, we review the main aspects of intrinsic geometric flows driven by the Ricci curvature, in various forms, and explain the intimate relation between Ricci and Calabi flows on Kahler manifolds using the notion of super-evolution. The integration of these flows on two-dimensional surfaces relies on the introduction of a novel class of infinite dimensional algebras with infinite growth. It is also explained in this context how Kac's K_2 simple Lie algebra can be used to construct metrics on S^2 with prescribed scalar curvature equal to the sum of any holomorphic function and its complex conjugate; applications of this special problem to general relativity and to a model of interfaces in statistical mechanics are also briefly discussed.","doi":"oai:arXiv.org:hep-th/0511057","title":"Geometric flows and (some of) their physical applications","createdAt":"2005-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","__v":0}{"keywords":["High Energy Physics - Theory",null,"Differential Geometry"],"_id":"5b2243f2fe146a0d3f04e938","abstract":"String backgrounds and D-branes do not possess the structure of Lorentzian manifolds, but that of manifolds with area metric.

The biKaehler sigma model is obtainable by gauge fixing the Hitchin model with generalized Kaehler target space. It further contains the customary A topological sigma model as a particular case.

We analyze in detail how the gravitational anomalies originate from the modified Einstein equations in the bulk. As a side observation we find that the gravitational Chern-Simons functional has interesting conformal properties. It is invariant under conformal transformations. Moreover, its metric variation produces conformal tensor which is a generalization of the Cotton tensor to dimension $d+1=4k-1, k\\in Z$. We calculate the modification of the holographic stress-energy tensor that is due to the Chern-Simons term and use the bulk Einstein equations to find its divergence and thus reproduce the gravitational anomaly. Explicit calculation of the anomaly is carried out in dimensions $d=2$ and $d=6$. The result of the holographic calculation is compared with that of the descent method and agreement is found.
